Q10. Subordinate judiciary and administrative tribunals; constitutional protection to civil servants.

1) Synopsis
Subordinate judiciary ensures grass-roots justice delivery, while tribunals provide specialised adjudication but must not dilute judicial review. Civil servants receive constitutional safeguards to ensure neutral administration with accountability.

2) Introduction

Judiciary is a unified system: SC/HC + subordinate courts.

Tribunals were created for speed/specialisation.

Civil service protections prevent arbitrary punishment and politicisation.

3) Laws/Statutes

Arts. 233–237 (subordinate judiciary)

Arts. 323A–323B (tribunals)

Art. 311 (civil servant protections)

Arts. 309–310 (service rules; pleasure doctrine with limits)

4) Answer body

District judiciary appointments and control are structured to maintain independence from executive (Arts. 233–235).

High Courts exercise control over subordinate courts to ensure integrity and efficiency.

Tribunals aim at specialised adjudication but cannot become substitutes eliminating constitutional courts.

Judicial review by HC/SC is part of constitutional scheme; tribunalisation cannot remove it.

Civil servants: although service is held under pleasure, Art. 311 provides procedural protection (charges, inquiry, opportunity).

Exceptions exist for security/discipline contexts but must follow constitutional conditions.

The net effect is independent justice + accountable administration.

5) Case laws

L. Chandra Kumar v. Union of India (1997) (1997) 3 SCC 261 — Held judicial review by HC/SC is part of basic structure; tribunals cannot replace constitutional courts.

Chandra Mohan v. State of U.P. (1966) AIR 1966 SC 1987 — Protected independence of district judiciary by insisting on constitutional separation from executive influence.

Union of India v. Tulsiram Patel (1985) (1985) 3 SCC 398 — Explained Art. 311 safeguards and exceptions, key for “constitutional protection” of civil servants.

Parshotam Lal Dhingra v. Union of India (1958) AIR 1958 SC 36 — Distinguished dismissal/removal/reduction and clarified when Art. 311 procedural protection applies.

S.P. Sampath Kumar v. Union of India (1987) (1987) 1 SCC 124 — Accepted tribunalisation subject to maintaining efficacy of judicial review, relevant background to tribunal framework.

6) Conclusion

Subordinate judiciary is constitutionally protected to preserve judicial independence.

Tribunals are valid but cannot eclipse HC/SC review.

Civil service safeguards balance state efficiency with fairness.

Q11. Public Service Commission: composition, powers, functions; services under Centre/State; relevant provisions.

1) Synopsis
PSCs institutionalise merit-based recruitment and protect administrative neutrality. Services under Centre/State are regulated through constitutional rule-making, with safeguards for fairness and stability.

2) Introduction

Civil services are the machinery of governance; neutrality requires merit systems.

PSCs are constitutional bodies ensuring transparent recruitment and advice.

Service rules must conform to constitutional constraints.

3) Laws/Statutes

Arts. 315–323 (UPSC/SPSC; functions; reports)

Arts. 309–312 (service rules; All-India Services)

Arts. 320–323 (consultation; scope)

Art. 311 (procedural protection)

4) Answer body

UPSC and SPSC are constitutional commissions for recruitment and advisory functions.

PSC advises on recruitment methods, disciplinary matters, promotions, and service conditions (Art. 320).

Consultation is a constitutional expectation, though the extent/mandatory nature is read with scheme and exceptions.

Service conditions can be framed by legislature or executive rules under Art. 309 until legislation.

All-India Services promote national integration and uniform standards (Art. 312).

PSC annual reports ensure legislative oversight and accountability.

Thus, PSCs strengthen governance by combining merit + constitutional supervision.

5) Case laws

State of U.P. v. Manbodhan Lal Srivastava (1958) AIR 1957 SC 912 — Held UPSC consultation breach does not automatically invalidate action, clarifying Art. 320’s operational effect.

Union of India v. Tulsiram Patel (1985) (1985) 3 SCC 398 — Detailed constitutional discipline in service law and procedural protections, supporting civil service safeguards.

Parshotam Lal Dhingra (1958) AIR 1958 SC 36 — Foundational test on “punishment” and Article 311 applicability in service jurisprudence.

Ajit Singh v. State of Punjab (1999) (1999) 7 SCC 209 — Important in service jurisprudence on promotion/seniority principles within constitutional equality framework.

All India Judges’ Assn. v. Union of India (1992) (1992) 1 SCC 119 — Strengthened institutional standards and service conditions (contextually useful for constitutional structuring of services).

6) Conclusion

PSCs constitutionalise meritocracy and fairness.

Service governance is structured by Arts. 309–312 with safeguards like Art. 311.

The design supports a neutral, efficient, accountable civil service.

Q12. Election Commission: role in free and fair elections; State liability for torts and contract (with cases).

1) Synopsis
The Election Commission is the constitutional guardian of electoral integrity and democratic legitimacy. State liability has evolved from sovereign immunity notions toward rule-of-law accountability in torts and contracts.

2) Introduction

Democracy requires elections that are free, fair, and periodic.

EC’s independence and plenary powers ensure credibility.

State liability reflects constitutional commitment to legality and compensation for wrongs.

3) Laws/Statutes

Art. 324 (EC: superintendence, direction, control)

Representation of the People Acts, 1950/1951 (electoral framework)

Art. 299 (Government contracts—formal requirements)

Art. 300 (suits by/against Union/State)

4) Answer body

EC’s Art. 324 power is broad to fill gaps where statutes are silent, ensuring free and fair polls.

It controls schedules, conduct, model code enforcement (administratively), recognition of parties/symbols (as per law), and election machinery supervision.

Judicial approach supports EC autonomy while ensuring legality and fairness.

State liability: constitutional scheme allows suits (Art. 300), and contracts require compliance with Art. 299 formalities for enforceability.

In torts, early doctrine protected “sovereign functions,” but constitutional remedies and public law compensation expanded accountability, especially where fundamental rights are violated.

The trend is toward constitutional tort and compensatory justice for State wrongs.

5) Case laws

Mohinder Singh Gill v. Chief Election Commissioner (1978) (1978) 1 SCC 405 — Recognised EC’s wide residual powers under Art. 324 to ensure free and fair elections.

T.N. Seshan v. Union of India (1995) (1995) 4 SCC 611 — Affirmed EC’s independence and clarified internal structure/powers supporting electoral integrity.

State of Rajasthan v. Vidyawati (1962) AIR 1962 SC 933 — Accepted State liability in tort in non-sovereign functions, an early move toward governmental accountability.

Kasturi Lal v. State of U.P. (1965) AIR 1965 SC 1039 — Applied sovereign function immunity in tort, used to show limits and evolution of State liability doctrine.

Nilabati Behera v. State of Orissa (1993) (1993) 2 SCC 746 — Awarded public law compensation for rights violation, establishing constitutional tort-style accountability.

6) Conclusion

EC is essential to free and fair elections, sustaining constitutional democracy.

State liability is increasingly aligned with rule of law and rights-based compensation.

Together they reinforce constitutional governance and accountability.
