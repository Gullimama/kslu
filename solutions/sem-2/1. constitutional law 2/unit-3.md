Q7. Speaker’s powers/functions; privileges; Anti-Defection law with leading cases.

1) Synopsis
The Speaker is the custodian of House procedure, discipline, and legislative functioning. Privileges protect legislative independence, while the Anti-Defection law enforces party stability, subject to constitutional limits and judicial review.

2) Introduction

Speaker ensures orderly debate and authenticates House actions.

Privileges secure functioning from outside interference.

Anti-defection addresses political instability but must respect democracy.

3) Laws/Statutes

Arts. 93–97; 178–181 (Speaker/Deputy Speaker)

Arts. 105 & 194 (parliamentary privileges)

Tenth Schedule (Anti-Defection)

Arts. 122 & 212 (bar on courts re: procedure; limited judicial review)

4) Answer body

Speaker presides, interprets rules, maintains order, certifies money bills (Lok Sabha), and decides disqualification under Tenth Schedule (as per scheme).

Privileges include freedom of speech in House, immunity for publications, and powers to punish contempt to protect institutional dignity.

Privileges are constitutional but not absolute: they must align with fundamental constitutional values and judicial review boundaries.

Anti-defection disqualifies members for voluntarily giving up membership or defying whip (subject to exceptions).

The law aims to prevent unprincipled floor-crossing, but risks suppressing internal dissent and deliberative democracy.

Courts permit judicial review of Speaker’s decisions on limited grounds (jurisdictional error, mala fides, constitutional violations).

Time-bound adjudication and neutrality expectations are critical for legitimacy.

5) Case laws

Kihoto Hollohan v. Zachillhu (1992) 1992 Supp (2) SCC 651 — Upheld the Tenth Schedule but made Speaker’s decisions judicially reviewable on limited grounds.

Raja Ram Pal v. Speaker, Lok Sabha (2007) (2007) 3 SCC 184 — Confirmed parliamentary privileges exist but are subject to constitutional limitations and judicial review.

P.V. Narasimha Rao v. State (CBI) (1998) (1998) 4 SCC 626 — Interpreted privilege protections for legislative acts, illustrating privilege scope and limits.

Keisham Meghachandra Singh v. Speaker (2020) (2020) 2 SCC 577 — Criticised delays in disqualification and urged time-bound Speaker decisions, vital for anti-defection effectiveness.

Nabam Rebia (2016) (2016) 8 SCC 1 — Addressed legislative procedure and the constitutional boundaries of presiding authorities, supporting Speaker neutrality principles.

6) Conclusion

Speaker is central to legislative integrity and procedure.

Privileges protect autonomy but remain constitutionally bounded.

Anti-defection promotes stability, yet must operate with fairness, neutrality, and judicially reviewable limits.

Q8. Judiciary: appointment, powers, jurisdiction, transfer of judges (Union and States).

1) Synopsis
The Indian judiciary is independent through security of tenure, constitutional status, and insulated appointments. Appointment and transfer doctrines evolved through judicial precedents to protect independence while enabling functional administration.

2) Introduction

Judiciary is the guardian of the Constitution via judicial review.

Independence is part of constitutional design.

Appointment/transfer mechanisms ensure balance between executive input and judicial primacy.

3) Laws/Statutes

Arts. 124–147 (Supreme Court)

Arts. 214–231 (High Courts)

Arts. 217, 222 (HC appointment; transfer)

Arts. 32, 226 (writ jurisdiction)

4) Answer body

Supreme Court and High Courts are constitutional courts with original, appellate, advisory jurisdictions (as structured).

Appointment: formal power with President, but constitutional practice shaped by “consultation” meaning and collegium evolution.

Independence requires appointments free from political dominance and transfers not used punitively.

Transfer of High Court judges (Art. 222) is permissible for public interest/administrative needs, but must respect judicial independence and procedural fairness.

Writ jurisdiction is central: Art. 32 is itself a fundamental right; Art. 226 is wider in scope for HCs.

Judicial review safeguards constitutional limits and fundamental rights.

5) Case laws

S.P. Gupta v. Union of India (1981) 1981 Supp SCC 87 — Early landmark on “consultation” and judicial independence, foundational to appointments discourse.

Supreme Court Advocates-on-Record Assn. v. Union of India (1993) (1993) 4 SCC 441 — Established Collegium primacy in appointments to secure judicial independence.

In re Presidential Reference (1998) (1998) 7 SCC 739 — Clarified collegium procedure and widened consultative base, refining appointments process.

Supreme Court Advocates-on-Record Assn. v. Union of India (NJAC) (2015) (2016) 5 SCC 1 — Struck down NJAC as violating judicial independence/basic structure, central for appointment control.

Sankalchand Himmatlal Sheth v. Union of India (1977) (1977) 4 SCC 193 — Upheld High Court judge transfers but insisted they must not undermine independence, directly relevant to Art. 222.

6) Conclusion

Judicial independence is structurally protected by constitutional design and precedent.

Appointment and transfer rules must serve independence + efficiency, not executive convenience.

The judiciary remains the constitutional sentinel through writs and review.

Q9. Role of judiciary in protecting fundamental rights and maintaining constitutional balance; evolution of judicial review.

1) Synopsis
Judicial review is the constitutional mechanism ensuring limited government and enforceable rights. The Supreme Court evolved doctrines to balance rights, governance, and constitutional structure.

2) Introduction

Constitution is supreme; all organs are subject to it.

FR enforcement is primarily through Arts. 32 and 226.

Balance is maintained by harmonising Parts III, IV, and federal structure.

3) Laws/Statutes

Arts. 13, 32, 226 (judicial review; writs)

Arts. 14, 19, 21 (rights core)

Art. 136 (special leave)

Art. 368 (amendment—limits via basic structure)

4) Answer body

Art. 13 makes unconstitutional laws void—foundation of judicial review.

Art. 32 provides direct remedy; courts treat rights as meaningful only with effective remedies.

Review extends to executive action as well as legislation; arbitrariness and unreasonableness are constitutionally controlled.

Courts developed “procedure established by law” into substantive fairness by reading due process values into Art. 21.

Rights interpretation moved from formalism to transformative, purposive readings for dignity and liberty.

Basic structure doctrine ensures Parliament cannot destroy constitutional identity.

Courts use doctrines like proportionality/reasonableness to balance rights with public interest.

5) Case laws

Kesavananda Bharati (1973) (1973) 4 SCC 225 — Created Basic Structure doctrine, ensuring judicial review protects constitutional identity.

Golaknath v. State of Punjab (1967) (1967) 2 SCR 762 — Treated FR as entrenched and limited amendment power (historical step in evolution).

R.C. Cooper v. Union of India (1970) (1970) 1 SCC 248 — Expanded rights review from form to effect/impact, strengthening substantive judicial review.

Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India (1978) (1978) 1 SCC 248 — Made Art. 21 procedure require fairness/non-arbitrariness, transforming rights protection.

I.R. Coelho v. State of Tamil Nadu (2007) (2007) 2 SCC 1 — Held Ninth Schedule laws after 24-4-1973 are reviewable if they damage basic structure, reinforcing supremacy of review.

6) Conclusion

Judicial review is the living guarantee of fundamental rights.

The judiciary preserves constitutional balance by enforcing limits on power.

Rights, structure, and democracy are protected through evolving constitutional interpretation.
