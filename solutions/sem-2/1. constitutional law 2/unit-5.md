Q13. Types of Emergency; effects; impact on Fundamental Rights (with cases).

1) Synopsis
Emergency provisions permit temporary constitutional shifts to protect the nation, but risk rights dilution and federal distortion. Judicial doctrine now emphasises reviewability, proportionality, and constitutional limits.

2) Introduction

Emergency is an exceptional constitutional regime.

It alters federal balance and rights enforcement.

Courts and amendments have attempted to prevent abuse.

3) Laws/Statutes

Art. 352 (National Emergency)

Art. 356 (President’s Rule)

Art. 360 (Financial Emergency)

Arts. 358–359 (effects on fundamental rights)

4) Answer body

Art. 352 can be proclaimed for war/external aggression/armed rebellion, shifting power heavily to Union.

Art. 356 addresses breakdown of constitutional machinery in States; historically misused, later judicially controlled.

Art. 360 permits financial emergency measures (rare in practice).

Art. 358 suspends Art. 19 during National Emergency (as applicable), while Art. 359 allows suspension of enforcement of specified rights by order (not the rights’ existence).

Post-experience, constitutional practice stresses that emergency is not a license for permanent authoritarianism.

Courts moved from deference to enforceable limits, insisting on objective material and review.

Fundamental rights impact is severe; hence, emergency must remain constitutionally constrained.

5) Case laws

A.D.M. Jabalpur v. Shivkant Shukla (1976) (1976) 2 SCC 521 — Held (then) that habeas corpus could be suspended during emergency; later widely criticised, used to show FR vulnerability.

Minerva Mills v. Union of India (1980) 1980 SCC (3) 625 — Reaffirmed limited amending power and basic structure, preventing emergency-style constitutional distortion.

S.R. Bommai (1994) (1994) 3 SCC 1 — Made President’s Rule subject to judicial review and protected federalism, vital for Art. 356 limits.

Rameshwar Prasad (2006) (2006) 2 SCC 1 — Quashed unconstitutional dissolution/356-type actions, reinforcing democracy during constitutional crises.

K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India (2017) (2017) 10 SCC 1 — Recognised privacy and dignity-based rights reasoning, useful to argue that rights-core must be protected even under exceptional regimes.

6) Conclusion

Emergency provisions are for constitutional survival, not constitutional suspension.

Rights and federalism are most vulnerable during emergencies.

Judicial review and constitutional doctrine now emphasise limits, legality, and democracy.

Q14. Constitutional interpretation: methods adopted by Indian judiciary.

1) Synopsis
Constitutional interpretation is purposive, structural, and rights-oriented, not narrow literalism. Indian courts employ interpretive techniques to preserve constitutional values, governance, and liberty.

2) Introduction

A Constitution is a living framework for governance.

Interpretation must harmonise text, structure, history, and values.

Methods evolve with constitutional needs.

3) Laws/Statutes

Preamble (values guiding interpretation)

Art. 13 (constitutional supremacy)

Arts. 32 & 226 (rights-enforcement context)

Art. 368 (amendment—limits affect interpretation)

4) Answer body

Literal/textual method applies where language is clear, but is rarely sufficient alone for constitutional problems.

Purposive method advances the object of provisions, especially in rights and governance.

Harmonious construction reconciles apparently conflicting provisions to maintain constitutional coherence.

Doctrine of pith and substance resolves federal disputes by identifying true nature of legislation.

Reading down / severability preserves constitutionality by narrowing or cutting offending portions.

Living constitution approach keeps rights meaningful with changing social contexts.

Structural interpretation (federalism, separation of powers, judicial independence) prevents distortion of constitutional design.

5) Case laws

Kesavananda Bharati (1973) (1973) 4 SCC 225 — Interpreted Art. 368 purposively to create basic structure limits, a landmark interpretive method example.

Maneka Gandhi (1978) (1978) 1 SCC 248 — Adopted expansive, value-based reading of Arts. 14/19/21 together, showing harmonious and purposive interpretation.

R.C. Cooper (1970) (1970) 1 SCC 248 — Shifted focus to effect/impact, illustrating substantive rights interpretation over formalism.

Minerva Mills (1980) 1980 SCC (3) 625 — Used structural interpretation to protect constitutional identity and balance between Parts III and IV.

I.R. Coelho (2007) (2007) 2 SCC 1 — Applied basic structure review to Ninth Schedule insertions, showing interpretive control over constitutional devices.

6) Conclusion

Indian interpretation is value-centric and structure-preserving.

Courts harmonise governance needs with rights and constitutional identity.

The methods collectively secure constitutional supremacy and workable democracy.

Q15. Constitutional amendment; Basic Structure; significance of Schedules; review of working of Constitution (with pronouncements).

1) Synopsis
Amendment power under Art. 368 is broad but not unlimited due to the Basic Structure doctrine. Schedules systematise constitutional administration (including Ninth Schedule), and judicial review evaluates constitutional functioning through doctrine and precedent.

2) Introduction

Amendments enable constitutional evolution.

Unlimited amendment risks constitutional destruction.

Basic Structure reconciles flexibility with identity.

3) Laws/Statutes

Art. 368 (amendment procedure & limits)

Ninth Schedule (laws insulated—subject to basic structure limits)

Arts. 32, 226 (review mechanism)

Preamble + structural principles (source of basic structure)

4) Answer body

Art. 368 provides procedures: simple majority for some matters; special majority; and ratification by States for federal provisions.

Basic Structure holds that Parliament cannot alter the Constitution’s identity—core principles like supremacy, democracy, federalism, judicial review, etc.

This doctrine prevents “amendment” from becoming “repeal in disguise.”

Schedules aid constitutional implementation: distribution lists (Seventh), anti-defection (Tenth), local bodies (Eleventh/Twelfth), etc.

Ninth Schedule was designed to protect socio-economic reforms, but judicial doctrine now ensures it cannot violate basic structure via post-1973 insertions.

“Review of working” is reflected through constitutional commissions, amendments, and judicial responses to misuse (e.g., emergency, Art. 356, tribunalisation).

The Constitution is thus maintained through a cycle of amendment + adjudication + accountability.

5) Case laws

Kesavananda Bharati (1973) (1973) 4 SCC 225 — Established Basic Structure doctrine, limiting Art. 368 and anchoring amendment validity.

Indira Nehru Gandhi v. Raj Narain (1975) 1975 Supp SCC 1 — Struck at amendments undermining free elections/judicial review, showing basic structure application.

Minerva Mills (1980) 1980 SCC (3) 625 — Invalidated clauses that destroyed limited amending power, reaffirming constitutional supremacy.

Waman Rao v. Union of India (1981) (1981) 2 SCC 362 — Laid down the 24-4-1973 cut-off approach for Ninth Schedule/basic structure interaction.

I.R. Coelho (2007) (2007) 2 SCC 1 — Held post-Kesavananda Ninth Schedule laws are reviewable if they damage basic structure, crucial for “Schedules + amendment limits.”

6) Conclusion

Art. 368 enables change, but Basic Structure prevents constitutional self-destruction.

Schedules are functional “constitutional toolkits,” yet remain subject to constitutional supremacy.

Judicial review ensures the Constitution works as a limited-power, rights-protecting democracy.
