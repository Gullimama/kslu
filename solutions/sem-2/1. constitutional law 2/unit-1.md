Q1. Explain the federal system under the Indian Constitution. Discuss the organization of State and Centre–State relations (Legislative, Financial, Administrative).

1) Synopsis (2 sentences)
India adopts a federal structure with a strong Centre, combining division of powers with constitutional supremacy and judicial review. Centre–State relations operate through legislative lists, financial distribution, and administrative coordination to maintain unity with regional autonomy.

2) Introduction (3 points)

Federalism means dual polity + distribution of powers + supremacy of Constitution.

Indian federalism is often described as “quasi-federal” / “federal with unitary bias” due to Centre’s overriding powers.

The Constitution creates an “indestructible Union of destructible States” and makes federalism workable through coordination.

3) Laws/Statutes (3–4)

Arts. 1, 245–255 (Union/State legislative power; distribution; repugnancy; assent)

Seventh Schedule (Union/State/Concurrent Lists)

Arts. 268–281 (financial distribution; Finance Commission)

Arts. 256–263 (administrative relations; directions; Inter-State Council)

4) Answer body (10–12 points)

India is a Union of States (Art. 1): States are constitutionally created units; Parliament can reorganize States (Art. 3), showing Centre strength.

Legislative relations rest on Arts. 245–255 and the Seventh Schedule: Union and States legislate within their fields; Concurrent List allows both.

Doctrine of repugnancy (Art. 254) ensures Union law prevails in Concurrent matters unless State law has President’s assent (Art. 254(2)).

Centre has “residuary power” (Entry 97, Union List) and can legislate in State field during emergency / national interest / consent mechanisms (e.g., Arts. 249, 250, 252).

Financial relations: major taxes are assigned/distributed; Finance Commission (Art. 280) recommends tax devolution and grants to ensure fiscal balance.

Centre exercises control through grants (Arts. 275, 282) and centrally-sponsored schemes—creating functional interdependence.

Administrative relations: States must comply with Union laws; Union can issue directions to ensure compliance (Arts. 256–257).

Certain subjects require All-India Services (Art. 312) to maintain uniform administration and national standards.

Inter-State coordination: disputes go to Supreme Court (Art. 131); Inter-State Council (Art. 263) supports cooperative decision-making.

Federalism in India is dynamic: it aims at national integrity while allowing regional governance through constitutionally structured autonomy.

Judicial review protects federal balance by checking both Union overreach and State deviation.

Thus, India operates a cooperative, integrated federal system with constitutional distribution and Centre-tilt safeguards.

Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala (1973) — (1973) 4 SCC 225

6) Conclusion (3 points)

Indian federalism is constitutionally federal but functionally Centre-strong.

Legislative, financial, and administrative arrangements ensure unity with workable autonomy.

Courts preserve the federal balance as part of the constitutional framework.

Q2. Critically examine Co-operative Federalism. Discuss Freedom of Trade & Commerce and Official Language with case laws.

1) Synopsis
Co-operative federalism reflects shared governance, where Union and States coordinate to achieve constitutional goals. Part XIII protects economic unity through free trade, subject to reasonable regulatory/tax exceptions.

2) Introduction

Co-operation is necessary because governance problems are inter-jurisdictional (finance, infrastructure, welfare).

The Constitution embeds co-operation via councils, commissions, and fiscal devolution.

Economic unity is protected by Part XIII (Arts. 301–307).

3) Laws/Statutes

Arts. 263, 280 (Inter-State Council; Finance Commission)

Arts. 301–307 (trade, commerce & intercourse)

Arts. 343–351 (Official language; linguistic safeguards)

Art. 256–257 (administrative coordination)

4) Answer body

A) Legislative Relations (5 high-scoring points)

Distribution of legislative competence is constitutionally done through Arts. 245–246 read with the Seventh Schedule (Union/State/Concurrent Lists), creating a limited government by subject-matter allocation.

In the Concurrent List, both can legislate, but Art. 254(1) establishes Union supremacy (repugnancy rule) where State law conflicts with Parliamentary law.

Art. 254(2) creates a controlled State override: a State law on a Concurrent subject may prevail only if reserved for and receives President’s assent, yet Parliament can still later override by making a law.

India’s federal tilt is strengthened by residuary power in Parliament (Union List Entry 97), meaning matters not enumerated belong to the Union—supporting “Centre-strong federalism.”

The Constitution permits temporary Union entry into State field under special mechanisms:

Art. 249 (Rajya Sabha resolution—national interest),

Art. 250 (during Emergency),

Art. 252 (State consent for Parliament to legislate),

ensuring national integration without permanent obliteration of State competence.

B) Financial Relations (5 high-scoring points)

Financial federalism is designed to secure fiscal unity + State viability through distribution of taxing powers and devolution under Arts. 268–281.

The Constitution separates revenue sources: some taxes are levied and collected by the Union but assigned/devolved, ensuring States receive constitutionally structured shares and not merely executive charity.

Finance Commission (Art. 280) is the key constitutional device that recommends vertical and horizontal devolution and grants, thereby operationalising cooperative fiscal federalism through an expert constitutional body.

Grants-in-aid under Art. 275 (and other grant mechanisms) act as equalisation tools to address regional imbalance, supporting the federal goal of balanced development.

Union financial influence also arises through conditional and purpose-based spending (commonly discussed as part of the Centre’s dominant fiscal position), meaning States often function with financial interdependence, not strict autonomy.

C) Administrative Relations (5 high-scoring points)

Arts. 256–257 impose constitutional duties on States to ensure compliance with Union laws and permit the Union to issue directions—administrative unity is maintained without formally destroying State executive power.

Union can require States to exercise executive power in a manner that does not impede Union executive power, reinforcing the “integrated administrative system” idea in India’s federal design.

All-India Services (Art. 312) create a cadre serving both levels, ensuring uniform standards, national cohesion, and administrative continuity, especially in policing/revenue administration.

Inter-State Council (Art. 263) institutionalises consultation and coordination, reflecting co-operative federalism through structured Centre–State dialogue.

For inter-governmental disputes, the Constitution provides judicial resolution through original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court (Art. 131), reinforcing that federal relations are legal/constitutional, not merely political.

5) Case laws

Case Laws (5) — one-line ratio + relevance to above answer

State of West Bengal v. Union of India (1963) AIR 1963 SC 1241; (1964) 1 SCR 371
→ Held that the Indian Constitution is not a compact of sovereign States; it creates a Union with strong Centre, supporting your structure + Centre-tilt points (Legislative/Overall).

S.R. Bommai v. Union of India (1994) 3 SCC 1
→ Treated federalism as a basic feature and judicially controlled misuse of federal-breaking measures (esp. Art. 356), supporting federal balance + constitutional limits (Administrative/Overall).

Union of India v. H.S. Dhillon (1972) 2 SCC 33
→ Clarified the width of Parliament’s residuary power (Entry 97), directly supporting Legislative point #4 (Centre’s residuary competence).

Atiabari Tea Co. v. State of Assam (1961) AIR 1961 SC 232; (1961) 1 SCR 809
→ Explained that direct and immediate restrictions on trade violate the freedom under Part XIII unless constitutionally justified—supports understanding of Centre–State economic integration (fits Unit-1 framework; links to federal functioning).

State of Rajasthan v. Union of India (1977) 3 SCC 592
→ Discussed limits and review of Centre’s role in State governance and the political–constitutional boundary, supporting Administrative relations and the Centre–State tension under constitutional structure.

6) Conclusion

Co-operative federalism is a constitutional necessity for effective governance.

Part XIII maintains economic unity while allowing limited, structured restrictions.

Language provisions constitutionalise unity without uniformity.

Q3. Local self-government (73rd/74th). Examine Art. 370 and Arts. 371-A to 371-J.

1) Synopsis
The 73rd and 74th Amendments constitutionalised grass-roots democracy through Panchayats and Municipalities. Special provisions like Art. 370 (J&K) and Arts. 371-A to 371-J reflect asymmetric federalism to accommodate regional diversity.

2) Introduction

Local bodies became a constitutional tier to deepen democracy and service delivery.

Special status provisions address historical, cultural, and administrative uniqueness.

These provisions aim at integration with accommodation.

3) Laws/Statutes

Part IX (Arts. 243–243O) — Panchayats (73rd Amendment)

Part IX-A (Arts. 243P–243ZG) — Municipalities (74th Amendment)

Art. 370 (J&K—special arrangement; now made inoperative by 2019 measures upheld in 2023)

Arts. 371-A to 371-J (special provisions for specific States)

4) Answer body

The 73rd Amendment gives constitutional status to Gram Sabha, elected Panchayats, fixed tenure, reservations, and State Election Commission mechanisms.

It mandates decentralised governance and planning through District Planning Committees/State Finance Commission support.

The 74th Amendment similarly constitutionalises Urban Local Bodies, wards, municipal functions, and metropolitan planning.

Together, they operationalise democratic decentralisation and participatory governance.

Art. 370 historically provided a special constitutional arrangement for J&K through Presidential Orders and concurrence mechanisms.

The Supreme Court has upheld continued operation/modification power historically and later adjudicated the 2019 measures.

Arts. 371-A to 371-J provide tailor-made safeguards (customary laws, land protections, regional development boards, etc.) to protect local identity and governance needs.

Such asymmetry is consistent with Indian federalism because the Constitution itself designs differentiated integration.

The constitutional theme is: strengthen democracy at the bottom and accommodate diversity at the periphery without breaking national unity.

Hence, local self-government and special provisions together reflect constitutional pluralism.

5) Case laws

Sampat Prakash v. State of J&K (1969) — (1969) 1 SCC 562

Mohd. Maqbool Damnoo v. State of J&K (1972) — (1972) 1 SCC 536

In Re: Article 370 of the Constitution (2023) — 2023 INSC 1058; 2023 SCC OnLine SC 1647

Kuldip Nayar v. Union of India (2006) — (2006) 7 SCC 1 (federal features)

Rameshwar Prasad v. Union of India (2006) — (2006) 2 SCC 1 (federal democracy)

6) Conclusion

73rd/74th Amendments make democracy participatory and local.

Art. 370 and Arts. 371-A to 371-J illustrate asymmetric federalism for unity with diversity.

The Constitution thereby balances decentralisation, integration, and regional safeguards.
