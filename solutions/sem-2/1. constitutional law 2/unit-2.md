Q4. Powers and functions of President and Governor. Parliament/State Legislature: bicameralism, composition, powers, functions.

1) Synopsis
The President and Governor are constitutional heads, exercising powers largely on aid and advice, with limited discretionary spaces. Legislatures perform law-making, financial control, and executive accountability, with bicameralism structured for review and representation.

2) Introduction

Parliamentary system: real executive = Council of Ministers, formal head = President/Governor.

Legislature is the central institution of democratic governance.

Bicameralism ensures reconsideration and continuity, but is limited at State level.

3) Laws/Statutes

Arts. 52–62, 72–78 (President; powers; pardons; CoM)

Arts. 153–167 (Governor; aid & advice; duties)

Arts. 79–122; 168–212 (Parliament/State legislature; privileges; procedure)

Arts. 107–111; 196–201 (legislative procedure; assent)

4) Answer body

President is the formal head; executive power vests in him but is exercised through Ministers (Arts. 53, 74).

Governor similarly is formal head of State executive (Art. 154) and normally acts on ministerial advice (Art. 163).

Key President functions: appointment powers, summoning/proroguing, ordinances (Art. 123), pardons (Art. 72), emergency roles.

Governor: ordinances (Art. 213), assent/reservation of Bills (Art. 200), and limited discretion in constitutional breakdown situations.

Parliament consists of President + two Houses (Art. 79); State legislature may be unicameral or bicameral (Art. 168).

Lok Sabha predominance in money matters; Rajya Sabha provides federal representation and deliberative review.

Legislative process: Bills, assent, and constitutional limitations; financial procedure gives special role to Lok Sabha.

Legislature controls executive through collective responsibility, questions, motions, committees, and budget approval.

Bicameralism is justified for revision and stability, but must not become obstructionist.

Overall, the model ensures responsible government under constitutional supremacy.

5) Case laws

Shamsher Singh v. State of Punjab (1974) AIR 1974 SC 2192 — Held President/Governor normally act on aid and advice, confirming they are constitutional heads.

Ram Jawaya Kapur v. State of Punjab (1955) AIR 1955 SC 549 — Explained the working of parliamentary executive and executive power within constitutional limits.

Nabam Rebia v. Deputy Speaker (2016) (2016) 8 SCC 1 — Restricted gubernatorial discretion and protected legislative processes, reinforcing responsible government norms.

Rameshwar Prasad v. Union of India (2006) (2006) 2 SCC 1 — Judicially scrutinised dissolution/constitutional breakdown claims, supporting limits on executive intervention.

Kuldip Nayar v. Union of India (2006) (2006) 7 SCC 1 — Upheld legislative arrangements consistent with federalism, supporting bicameral/federal rationale.

6) Conclusion

President/Governor are constitutional heads, not parallel executives.

Legislatures are law-making + accountability engines of parliamentary democracy.

Bicameralism supports deliberation and federal balance.

Q5. Collective responsibility. Position of PM and CM.

1) Synopsis
Collective responsibility is the constitutional device that makes the executive answerable to the legislature. The Prime Minister and Chief Minister are the real executive heads, coordinating government and ensuring cabinet coherence.

2) Introduction

Parliamentary democracy rests on confidence of the House.

Cabinet government needs unity, secrecy, and solidarity.

PM/CM are “keystones” of the parliamentary executive.

3) Laws/Statutes

Art. 75(3) (CoM collectively responsible to Lok Sabha)

Art. 164(2) (State CoM collectively responsible to Assembly)

Arts. 74, 163 (aid & advice)

Arts. 78, 167 (duties of PM/CM to communicate decisions/info)

4) Answer body

Collective responsibility means the CoM stands or falls together; a defeat on key issues implies loss of confidence.

It ensures democratic accountability: policies must be defensible in the House.

It implies cabinet solidarity: Ministers must publicly support decisions or resign.

The PM leads the Council: chooses ministers, allocates portfolios, sets agenda, and coordinates inter-ministerial policy.

PM is the principal link between President and Council; ensures functioning under Art. 78 duties.

CM performs the equivalent role at State level under Art. 167: leadership + coordination + legislative management.

Individual responsibility coexists: a minister may be removed for departmental failure, but cabinet survives unless confidence is lost.

PM/CM dominance is political, but constitutionally bounded by the House, party system, and constitutional norms.

Thus, the doctrine translates constitutional form into responsible governance.

5) Case laws

Shamsher Singh (1974) AIR 1974 SC 2192 — Reinforced that real executive power is exercised through the Council of Ministers, aligning with collective responsibility.

U.N.R. Rao v. Indira Gandhi (1971) (1971) 2 SCC 63 — Clarified constitutional necessity of a functioning Council/PM framework for parliamentary governance.

S.R. Bommai (1994) (1994) 3 SCC 1 — Strengthened legislative confidence principles and federal democracy, supporting why CoM must remain accountable.

Nabam Rebia (2016) (2016) 8 SCC 1 — Protected the floor-test/legislative confidence logic central to collective responsibility.

Rameshwar Prasad (2006) (2006) 2 SCC 1 — Condemned unconstitutional dissolution, reinforcing that executive legitimacy flows from the House.

6) Conclusion

Collective responsibility is the constitutional spine of parliamentary government.

PM/CM provide unity, leadership, and accountability.

The system ensures the executive remains answerable to elected representatives.

Q6. Centre and State executive relationship; parliamentary democracy influence (with case laws).

1) Synopsis
Centre–State executive relations combine autonomy in State governance with Union’s coordinating/supervisory powers. Parliamentary democracy ensures executives at both levels remain responsible to legislatures, not personally sovereign.

2) Introduction

Dual executive exists but is integrated by constitutional duties and directions.

Governor’s role often becomes the constitutional interface.

Democratic legitimacy comes through legislative confidence.

3) Laws/Statutes

Arts. 256–257 (Union directions; administrative coordination)

Arts. 74, 75(3), 163, 164(2) (responsible government)

Arts. 155–156, 200, 356 (Governor; assent; breakdown)

Art. 365 (failure to comply with Union directions)

4) Answer body

State executive power is constitutionally vested in Governor but exercised through CoM responsible to Assembly.

Union ensures constitutional compliance using Arts. 256–257 directions and administrative cooperation mechanisms.

Governor’s functions—assent, reservation, report—create a constitutional channel between Union and State.

Parliamentary democracy means the executive cannot rule without legislative support; this restrains arbitrariness at both levels.

Misuse risks arise when Centre attempts partisan control via gubernatorial discretion or Art. 356.

Courts have insisted that federal democracy requires constitutional morality, objective satisfaction, and justiciable limits.

Thus, executive relations must preserve State autonomy while maintaining constitutional unity.

5) Case laws

S.R. Bommai (1994) (1994) 3 SCC 1 — Made federalism and legislative majority principles judicially enforceable, limiting Centre’s misuse of Art. 356.

Shamsher Singh (1974) AIR 1974 SC 2192 — Confirms aid-and-advice model at both levels, shaping Centre–State executive functioning.

Rameshwar Prasad (2006) (2006) 2 SCC 1 — Applied strict scrutiny to breakdown claims, preserving State autonomy and democratic process.

Nabam Rebia (2016) (2016) 8 SCC 1 — Curbed unconstitutional gubernatorial steps, reinforcing parliamentary democracy at State level.

B.P. Singhal v. Union of India (2010) (2010) 6 SCC 331 — Held Governor removal cannot be arbitrary, reinforcing constitutional morality in Centre–State relations.

6) Conclusion

Executive federalism in India is coordinated, not compartmentalised.

Parliamentary responsibility limits both Union and State executives.

Judicial review keeps the federal democratic balance constitutionally aligned.
