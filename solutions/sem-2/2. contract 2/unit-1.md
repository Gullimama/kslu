Q1. Define Contract of Indemnity; nature/scope; rights of indemnity-holder; commencement of indemnifier’s liability (with cases)

1) Synopsis (2 sentences)
A contract of indemnity is a promise to save another from loss, creating a protective obligation triggered by specified risks. The indemnity-holder’s rights include recovery of damages/costs, and courts recognise that liability can commence when the indemnity-holder’s liability becomes absolute.

2) Introduction (3 points)

Indemnity is a risk-allocation contract used in commerce to secure one party against contingent loss.

It is governed primarily by Sections 124–125 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, and supplemented by equitable principles discussed in standard texts.

The core scoring themes are definition, scope beyond literal wording, rights under s.125, and when liability “commences.”

3) Laws/Statutes (3–4)

ICA, 1872 s.124 — definition of indemnity (loss caused by promisor’s conduct or another’s conduct).

ICA, 1872 s.125 — rights of indemnity-holder (damages, costs, compromise sums).

ICA, 1872 s.126–147 (linkage) — distinction from guarantee framework (tri-partite).

General principles of damages/compensation (contractual loss + costs as contemplated).

4) Answer Body (10–12 points)

Definition (s.124): indemnity is a contract by which one party promises to save the other from loss caused by the promisor’s conduct or by another’s conduct.

Nature: it is primarily compensatory, shifting the burden of loss from indemnity-holder to indemnifier for the specified event.

Parties: typically two parties (indemnifier and indemnity-holder), unlike guarantee which involves a principal debtor.

Scope: though s.124 uses a limited phrasing, texts explain that in practice indemnity covers wider commercial indemnities (express indemnities for various risks).

Object: to ensure the indemnity-holder is never left to bear the loss which the indemnifier undertook to cover.

Rights under s.125(1): indemnity-holder can recover all damages he may be compelled to pay in any suit relating to the indemnity.

Rights under s.125(2): he can recover all costs reasonably incurred in bringing/defending such suit, if acting prudently/with authority.

Rights under s.125(3): he can recover amounts paid under reasonable compromise (not contrary to indemnifier’s directions).

Commencement of liability: a key scoring issue—courts have held the indemnity-holder need not wait for actual payment if his liability has become absolute/inevitable.

This prevents injustice: otherwise the indemnity-holder would need to first pay from his pocket, defeating the protective purpose of indemnity.

Thus, when liability becomes fixed (e.g., decree/settlement creating enforceable obligation), the indemnifier’s duty to make good the loss effectively arises.

Conclude by tying back: indemnity is about making the indemnity-holder whole, including damages, costs, and compromise sums as per s.125.

6) Conclusion (3 points)

Indemnity (s.124–125) is a commercial security device ensuring reimbursement of loss and related litigation costs/compromise payments.

The indemnity-holder’s statutory rights under s.125 are central for full marks.

Courts support the purpose by recognising that indemnifier’s liability can arise when the indemnity-holder’s liability becomes absolute, not merely after payment.

Q2. Contract of Guarantee; distinguish indemnity vs guarantee; rights of surety; discharge of surety (with cases)

1) Synopsis (2 sentences)
A guarantee is a tri-partite contract ensuring performance of the principal debtor’s obligation, creating co-extensive liability of the surety. For scoring, write definition (s.126), distinctions from indemnity, rights of surety (subrogation/indemnity), and discharge (ss.133–141).

2) Introduction (3 points)

Guarantee strengthens credit by adding a secondary obligor (surety).

It is governed by ICA ss.126–147, and is analysed through nature of liability, rights of surety, and discharge rules.

Examiners expect crisp differences from indemnity + structured discharge grounds.

3) Laws/Statutes (3–4)

ICA s.126 — definition (principal debtor, creditor, surety).

ICA s.128 — surety’s liability is co-extensive with principal debtor unless otherwise provided.

ICA ss.140–141 — surety’s rights (subrogation; benefit of securities).

ICA ss.133–139 — discharge (variation, release, creditor’s acts/omissions, impairment of remedy).

4) Answer Body (10–12 points)

Definition (s.126): guarantee is a contract to perform a promise/discharge liability of a third person (principal debtor) in case of default.

Parties: guarantee has three parties—creditor, principal debtor, surety—though principal debtor may not always be a direct contracting party with surety.

Nature: surety’s obligation is secondary, triggered on principal debtor’s default; indemnity is primary between two parties.

Indemnity vs Guarantee (key distinctions):

Parties: 2 vs 3;

Liability: primary (indemnifier) vs secondary (surety);

Purpose: loss-protection vs debt/performance security;

Right of recovery: surety has statutory rights against principal debtor (subrogation), indemnity-holder proceeds against indemnifier.

Co-extensive liability (s.128): surety’s liability matches principal debtor’s in extent and manner unless contract varies it.

Rights of surety (s.140): on payment/performance, surety is subrogated to all creditor’s rights against principal debtor.

Right to benefit of securities (s.141): surety is entitled to every security creditor holds; if creditor loses it, surety is discharged to that extent.

Discharge by variation (s.133): any material variance in contract terms without surety’s consent discharges surety for subsequent transactions.

Discharge by release (s.134): releasing/discharging principal debtor discharges surety (subject to recognised exceptions).

Discharge by creditor’s act/omission (s.139): if creditor impairs surety’s eventual remedy against principal debtor, surety is discharged.

Surety not entitled to “exhaust remedies first”: creditor can proceed against surety directly; surety’s liability is immediate on default.

A high-scoring close: rights (ss.140–141) balance the strictness of liability (s.128), while discharge provisions prevent unfair enlargement of surety’s risk.

Birkmyr v. Darnell, (1704) 1 Salk 27 (classic guarantee principle).

Holme v. Brunskill, (1878) 3 QBD 495 (variance discharges surety).

6) Conclusion (3 points)

Guarantee (ss.126–147) is a tri-partite security with surety’s co-extensive liability (s.128).

Surety’s rights (ss.140–141) and discharge rules (ss.133–139) ensure fairness by preventing unconsented risk expansion.

Using definition + differences + rights + discharge in section-order is the most scoring structure.

Q3. Extent of surety’s liability; co-surety and liability of co-sureties (with cases)

1) Synopsis (2 sentences)
Surety’s liability is generally co-extensive with that of the principal debtor, unless limited by contract, and can be enforced without first suing the principal debtor. Co-sureties share a contribution obligation and may be liable equally or as per agreed shares.

2) Introduction (3 points)

“Extent of liability” is examiner shorthand for s.128 + contract terms + enforcement principles.

Co-surety questions require contribution + equality + exceptions.

The best answer ties s.128 with the practical rule that creditor can proceed straight against surety.

3) Laws/Statutes (3–4)

ICA s.128 — co-extensive liability unless otherwise provided.

ICA s.146 — co-sureties liable to contribute equally (in absence of contract).

ICA s.147 — co-sureties for different sums contribute proportionately.

ICA ss.140–141 — subrogation and securities relevant after payment.

4) Answer Body (10–12 points)

Rule (s.128): surety’s liability is co-extensive—same amount, same conditions—unless guarantee contract restricts it.

Contractual limitation: surety may cap liability, restrict to specific transactions, time, or conditions; courts enforce clear limits.

Immediate enforceability: creditor can sue surety on default; surety cannot insist creditor first exhaust principal debtor remedies.

Continuing guarantee: liability may cover a series of transactions until revoked/terminated as per contract/statutory framework.

Effect of creditor’s securities: surety expects benefit of securities; impairment can reduce discharge to that extent (s.141).

Co-surety concept: two or more sureties for the same debt/obligation—relationship of shared burden.

Contribution (s.146): if one surety pays more than his share, he can recover contribution from co-sureties—equal sharing absent contract.

Different guaranteed sums (s.147): where co-sureties bind themselves for different amounts, contribution is proportionate up to their maximum liabilities.

Private arrangement: co-sureties can agree unequal shares; contribution follows the agreement inter se.

Practical scoring link: co-extensive liability is creditor-facing (s.128), contribution is surety-facing (ss.146–147).

After payment, surety obtains rights: subrogation against principal debtor (s.140) and securities (s.141).

Summation: extent is defined by statute + contract; co-surety doctrine ensures equitable distribution of payment burden.

5) Case Laws (5, with year & citation)

Bank of Bihar Ltd. v. Damodar Prasad, AIR 1969 SC 297 (creditor can proceed against surety).

State Bank of India v. Saksaria Sugar Mills Ltd., AIR 1986 SC 868 (surety liability principles).

Deering v. Earl of Winchelsea, (1787) 2 Bos & Pul 270 (foundation of contribution).

6) Conclusion (3 points)

Extent of surety’s liability is co-extensive by default (s.128), but may be contractually limited.

Co-sureties are governed by contribution rules (ss.146–147), ensuring fair distribution inter se.

A top answer cleanly separates: creditor vs surety rights, and single surety vs co-surety.
