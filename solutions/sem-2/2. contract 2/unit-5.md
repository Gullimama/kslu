Q13. Sale vs agreement to sell; conditions vs warranties (with cases)

1) Synopsis (2 sentences)
A sale transfers property in goods immediately, while an agreement to sell transfers property at a future time/subject to conditions. Conditions are essential stipulations whose breach permits repudiation, whereas warranties are collateral and typically sound in damages.

2) Introduction (3 points)

Sale of Goods Act, 1930 governs transfer of ownership and risk in goods transactions.

“Sale vs agreement to sell” is about timing of property transfer; “condition vs warranty” is about importance of stipulation and remedies.

Scoring requires definitions (s.4, s.12) + consequences and remedies.

3) Laws/Statutes (3–4)

SOGA s.4 — sale and agreement to sell.

SOGA s.12 — condition and warranty.

SOGA ss.13–17 — implied terms/conditions/warranties; when condition treated as warranty (s.13).

SOGA s.59 — damages for breach of warranty.

4) Answer Body (10–12 points)

Sale (s.4): contract where seller transfers or agrees to transfer property in goods to buyer for price; sale = property transfers immediately.

Agreement to sell: transfer is to take place in future or subject to conditions; becomes sale when time elapses/conditions fulfilled.

Effect on risk/ownership: sale gives buyer proprietary rights immediately; agreement to sell gives jus in personam until it becomes sale.

Insolvency consequences: difference matters—on seller insolvency, buyer’s rights are stronger if property already passed.

Condition (s.12(2)): stipulation essential to main purpose; breach allows repudiation + damages.

Warranty (s.12(3)): collateral stipulation; breach gives damages but not rejection (generally).

When condition becomes warranty (s.13): buyer may waive condition or elect to treat breach as warranty; also where contract indivisible and goods accepted.

Implied conditions (ss.14–16): title, description, quality/fitness, merchantability depending on transaction.

Implied warranties (s.14(b) etc.): quiet possession, freedom from encumbrances.

Remedies alignment: breach of condition → rejection/repudiation; breach of warranty → damages (s.59).

Apply with one example: car for touring purpose → fitness condition; breach allows rejection (classic).

Close by stating that classification controls remedy and commercial certainty.

Wallis v. Pratt, [1911] AC 394 (description condition).

6) Conclusion (3 points)

Sale vs agreement to sell (s.4) hinges on when property passes, affecting insolvency and risk outcomes.

Condition vs warranty (s.12–13) determines whether buyer can reject or only claim damages.

Citing s.4 + s.12 + s.13 and one fitness/title case is a full-marks template.

Q14. Passing of property; transfer of title; performance of contract (with cases)

1) Synopsis (2 sentences)
Passing of property is governed by statutory rules based on intention, classification of goods, and appropriation, and title transfer is constrained by the nemo dat rule with statutory exceptions. Performance includes delivery/acceptance/payment rules and rights/obligations of parties.

2) Introduction (3 points)

Ownership transfer decides risk, remedies, and insolvency outcomes.

“Transfer of title” tests nemo dat and exceptions protecting good faith buyers.

Performance is the operational part: delivery, acceptance, and payment as per Act.

3) Laws/Statutes (3–4)

SOGA ss.18–26 — rules for passing of property (specific/unascertained goods; appropriation).

SOGA s.27 — nemo dat quod non habet (no one gives what he doesn’t have).

SOGA ss.27–30 — exceptions (mercantile agent, voidable title, seller/buyer in possession).

SOGA ss.31–37 — delivery; payment; acceptance; part delivery.

4) Answer Body (10–12 points)

General rule (s.19): property passes when parties intend; intention gathered from contract terms, conduct, and circumstances.

Specific goods in deliverable state (s.20): property passes at contract time, irrespective of payment/delivery, unless contrary intention.

Specific goods to be put into deliverable state (s.21): property passes when seller completes required act and buyer has notice.

Goods to be weighed/measured (s.22): property passes when act done and buyer notified.

Unascertained/future goods (s.18): no property passes until goods are ascertained.

Appropriation (s.23): unconditional appropriation of goods to contract with mutual assent transfers property.

Risk (s.26): risk generally follows property unless agreed otherwise.

Transfer of title (s.27): nemo dat—buyer gets no better title than seller has.

Key exceptions (ss.27–30): mercantile agent disposition; sale under voidable title before rescission; seller/buyer in possession after sale enabling good faith transfer.

Performance (s.31): seller must deliver and buyer must accept/pay in accordance with contract.

Delivery rules (ss.33–36): delivery may be actual/symbolic/constructive; place/time depend on contract and reasonableness.

Acceptance (s.42): buyer accepts by intimation, acts inconsistent with seller’s ownership, or retention beyond reasonable time.

6) Conclusion (3 points)

Passing of property (ss.18–26) is intention-centred with statutory rules for common scenarios.

Transfer of title (s.27) is nemo dat subject to protective exceptions (ss.27–30).

Performance marks are secured by writing delivery/acceptance/payment rules in section order.

Q15. Rights of unpaid seller; remedies for breach (with cases)

1) Synopsis (2 sentences)
An unpaid seller has powerful rights against goods (lien, stoppage, resale) and against buyer personally (suit for price/damages). Remedies for breach align with whether property has passed and whether the breach is repudiatory or collateral.

2) Introduction (3 points)

Unpaid seller provisions protect sellers against buyer default in credit and shipment contexts.

Examiners want rights against goods first, then rights against buyer, then breach remedies.

Write definitions and sections cleanly: s.45 then ss.46–54, plus suit remedies.

3) Laws/Statutes (3–4)

SOGA s.45 — who is an unpaid seller.

SOGA ss.46–54 — unpaid seller’s rights: lien, stoppage, resale, withholding delivery.

SOGA s.55 — suit for price; s.56 — damages for non-acceptance.

SOGA s.57–60 — repudiation/anticipatory breach, interest, special damages (as applicable).

4) Answer Body (10–12 points)

Unpaid seller (s.45): seller unpaid when whole price not paid/tendered or conditional payment instrument dishonoured.

Rights against goods (s.46): lien, stoppage in transit, and resale; also right to withhold delivery where property not passed.

Lien (ss.47–49): right to retain possession until payment when sale without credit, credit expired, or buyer insolvent.

Part delivery (s.48): lien may continue for remainder unless waived by circumstances.

Termination of lien (s.49): ends when seller delivers to carrier without reserving disposal right, or buyer obtains lawful possession, or lien waived.

Stoppage in transit (ss.50–52): on buyer insolvency, seller can intercept goods during transit and regain possession.

Transit duration: begins on delivery to carrier and ends when buyer/agent takes delivery; factual determination matters.

Resale (s.54): seller may resell in perishable goods or after notice; resale affects buyer’s rights and seller’s damages accounting.

Rights against buyer personally: suit for price (s.55) where property passed or price payable on day certain; damages for non-acceptance (s.56).

Buyer’s breach remedies: seller may claim damages; if anticipatory repudiation, seller may treat as breach (s.60) and sue.

Measure of damages: generally difference between contract price and market price at breach date, subject to mitigation.

Close by mapping: goods-rights protect security; personal remedies ensure monetary recovery.

5) Case Laws (5, with year & citation)

Rowland v. Divall, [1923] 2 KB 500 (price recovery/title issues).

M/S. Shantilal & Co. v. Union of India, AIR 1981 SC 1249 (damages/contract breach principles—used in sale disputes).

Kwei Tek Chao v. British Traders & Shippers Ltd, [1954] 2 QB 459 (delivery/performance breach context).

6) Conclusion (3 points)

Unpaid seller rights (s.45–54) are a statutory protection package: lien, stoppage, resale, withholding delivery.

Personal remedies (ss.55–56) and breach provisions ensure price/damages recovery depending on property and breach type.

The highest scoring answer writes s.45 definition + s.46 classification + lien/stoppage/resale + suit for price/damages.
