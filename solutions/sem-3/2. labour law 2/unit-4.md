Q10) EPF Act 1952: discuss PF Scheme, Pension Scheme, EDLI Scheme – salient features.
1) Synopsis

The EPF law creates a compulsory contributory social insurance system through Provident Fund, Pension (EPS), and Deposit Linked Insurance (EDLI) schemes. It secures post-employment dignity by mandating contributions, defining coverage, and empowering authorities for compliance and recovery.

2) Introduction

EPF is a foundational social security instrument for organised labour.

It ensures long-term savings, survivor benefits, and retirement security.

Courts interpret EPF as beneficial legislation with strong enforcement powers.

3) Laws/Statutes

Employees’ Provident Funds & Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952.

Schemes: EPF Scheme 1952, EPS 1995, EDLI 1976 (as framed under the Act).

Key provisions: coverage, contributions, authorities, inspections, damages/recovery.

4) Answer body

Applicability depends on establishment category/threshold; “employee” and “basic wages” definitions control contribution base.

EPF Scheme: mandatory employee + employer contributions into PF account; withdrawals/advances permitted under conditions.

EPS (Pension): part of employer contribution diverted for pension; provides superannuation/disablement/survivor pension subject to scheme conditions.

EDLI: insurance benefit linked to PF balances/contributions payable to nominee/legal heirs upon death in service.

Authorities include Central Board/Commissioners with powers of determination, inspection, and enforcement.

The Act provides coercive recovery: attachment, arrears, and prosecution; delays can attract damages/interest.

“Basic wages” interpretation prevents wage camouflage to evade contributions (judicial trend on allowances).

Recent litigation has addressed higher pension options under EPS and compliance timelines (important for “latest pronouncements”).

EPF compliance is treated as public welfare obligation overriding private contracts to the contrary.

Exemptions (where permitted) are conditional and require equivalent benefits.

The scheme supports portability and continuity for workers changing establishments.

Overall, EPF creates a statutory social insurance floor for organised sector.

5) Case laws (5)

Regional PF Commissioner v. Hooghly Mills Co. Ltd. (2012), (2012) 2 SCC 489.

Manipal Academy of Higher Education v. PF Commissioner (2008), (2008) 5 SCC 428 (basic wages).

Surya Roshni Ltd. v. EPFO (2019) (basic wages/allowances principle).

EPFO v. Sunil Kumar B. (2022) (higher pension/EPS option).

Bridge & Roof Co. (India) Ltd. v. Union of India (1963) (coverage/interpretation).

6) Conclusion

EPF law integrates savings, pension, and insurance into a single compulsory welfare architecture.

Schemes are implemented through strong regulatory and recovery powers to ensure compliance.

Exam scoring: define coverage + describe 3 schemes + contribution/benefits + authorities + recent case trend.

Q11) Maternity Benefit Act, 1961: object, scope, benefits; case laws.
1) Synopsis

The Maternity Benefit Act secures women’s reproductive health by mandating paid maternity leave and related benefits, preventing dismissal and wage loss due to pregnancy. Courts interpret it as beneficial social security legislation aligned with Articles 42 and 21.

2) Introduction

Maternity protection is a constitutional commitment under Article 42.

The Act ensures women do not face economic penalty for motherhood.

It promotes equality and dignity by ensuring leave, medical benefits, and job protection.

3) Laws/Statutes

Maternity Benefit Act, 1961: eligibility, leave, payment, medical bonus, nursing breaks, dismissal protections.

Constitution: Articles 14, 15(3), 21, 42.

ESI Act interface: where ESI applies, maternity benefits may be through ESI instead.

4) Answer body

The Act applies to notified establishments/factories/shops as per coverage.

It defines “wages”, “employer”, and conditions for entitlement linked to days worked.

Core benefit: paid maternity leave for prescribed period with wage protection.

Additional benefits: medical bonus (where no pre-natal care provided), miscarriage leave, illness leave, and nursing breaks.

It prohibits dismissal/penal action during maternity period and provides for reinstatement and payment where violated.

Inspectors/enforcement mechanisms ensure compliance and penal consequences for breach.

Courts interpret “week” and computation liberally to include full cycles, avoiding benefit dilution.

Courts have extended principles to vulnerable categories (e.g., muster roll workers) to uphold welfare objectives.

The Act strengthens workplace gender justice and reduces structural discrimination in employment.

The statute functions as a minimum floor; employers may provide better benefits by contract/policy.

Link to constitutional equality: protective discrimination under Article 15(3) and dignity under Article 21.

Thus, maternity benefit is a legal right ensuring health and economic security.

5) Case laws (5)

B. Shah v. Presiding Officer, Labour Court, Coimbatore (1977), 1977 SCC (4) 334 : AIR 1978 SC 12.

Municipal Corporation of Delhi v. Female Workers (Muster Roll) (2000), (2000) 3 SCC 224 : AIR 2000 SC 1274.

Neera Mathur v. LIC (1992), (1992) 1 SCC 286 (pregnancy discrimination).

Deepika Singh v. Central Administrative Tribunal (2022), (2022) 7 SCC 289 (parenthood/caregiver lens).

Shah v. Presiding Officer principle reaffirmations in later service jurisprudence.

6) Conclusion

The Act is a social security statute enforcing constitutional maternity relief.

Benefits combine leave + wages + medical support + job protection.

Courts interpret it liberally to prevent benefit-evasion and uphold dignity.

Q12) Critically analyse “social security” under constitutional mandate; importance of health/safety/welfare via social insurance.
1) Synopsis

Social security is the State’s organised response to risks like sickness, maternity, old age, unemployment, and employment injury through social assistance and social insurance. The Constitution mandates it via DPSPs and courts link it to right to life with dignity.

2) Introduction

Social security is not charity; it is welfare justice.

It ensures workers’ resilience against life contingencies.

India’s model combines contributory schemes (PF/ESI) and assistance programmes.

3) Laws/Statutes

Constitution: Articles 21, 38, 39(e), 41, 42, 43, 47.

Social insurance laws: EPF Act 1952, ESI Act 1948, Maternity Benefit Act 1961, Gratuity Act 1972.

Safety/welfare laws: Factories Act 1948, CLRA welfare provisions.

4) Answer body

Social security covers income maintenance and services during contingencies (sickness, maternity, disablement, old age, death).

DPSPs impose a positive duty: Article 41 (public assistance), 42 (humane conditions & maternity), 43 (living wage).

Courts read social security into Article 21’s dignity, especially regarding occupational health and medical aid.

Social insurance is contributory: risks pooled across employers/employees with statutory regulation.

Health and safety are indispensable: unsafe work undermines dignity and productive citizenship.

Welfare statutes require employers to internalise social costs of labour (medical care, retirement benefits).

Social security also stabilises industrial relations by reducing insecurity and conflict.

It promotes gender equality through maternity protection and workplace safeguards.

In a globalised economy, social security prevents labour “race to the bottom” and maintains minimum humane standards.

Critical issues: coverage gaps (informal sector), compliance evasion, and administrative delays.

Constitutional mandate justifies expanding coverage and strengthening enforcement mechanisms.

Thus, social security is both a constitutional goal and a justiciable dignity interest.

5) Case laws (5)

Consumer Education & Research Centre v. Union of India (1995), 1995 SCC (3) 42 (right to health/worker protection).

Olga Tellis v. Bombay Municipal Corporation (1985), 1985 SCC (3) 545 (livelihood as part of Article 21).

Bandhua Mukti Morcha v. Union of India (1984), (1984) 3 SCC 161 (dignity + labour welfare enforcement).

People’s Union for Democratic Rights v. Union of India (1982), (1982) 3 SCC 235 (anti-exploitation and minimum wage).

Paschim Banga Khet Mazdoor Samity v. State of W.B. (1996), (1996) 4 SCC 37 (medical aid as part of Article 21).

6) Conclusion

Social security is constitutionally mandated through DPSPs and dignity-based jurisprudence.

Social insurance schemes operationalise health, safety, and welfare as enforceable standards.

Stronger coverage and enforcement determine whether India’s welfare-State promise is realised.
