Q7) Child Labour Act 1986: prohibition + regulation; discuss 2016 Amendment.
1) Synopsis

The 1986 law originally prohibited child labour in specified hazardous occupations/processes and regulated conditions elsewhere; the 2016 Amendment shifted to a near-total ban on child employment (<14) and prohibited hazardous work for adolescents (14–18). The amendment is criticised for broad “family enterprise” exceptions and enforcement gaps.

2) Introduction

Child labour violates constitutional morality and human rights.

Law aims at abolition + education prioritisation + penal deterrence.

2016 reform aligns with developmental policy but faces implementation criticism.

3) Laws/Statutes

Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act, 1986 (as amended).

Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016.

Constitution: Articles 24, 21A, 39(f), 45 (child protection/education).

Juvenile Justice Act / RTE Act (contextual child protection).

4) Answer body

The pre-2016 framework used a schedule-based prohibition model (hazardous list) and regulated work conditions elsewhere.

“Child” now effectively means below 14, and employment is prohibited across occupations, subject to limited exceptions.

“Adolescent” category (14–18) is barred from hazardous occupations/processes, strengthening protection.

Regulation covers hours, rest, holidays, health and safety, and record-keeping where permitted.

Enforcement relies on inspectors and prosecution; penalties act as deterrence.

2016 Amendment increased deterrence and aligned with education goals, but created exceptions for family enterprise/after school that can be misused.

Hazardous list updates are crucial; without periodic revision, protection becomes under-inclusive.

Courts have directed rehabilitation/compensation mechanisms and state monitoring.

Employer liability is central, but supply-chain and informal sector makes enforcement difficult.

Effective abolition requires linkage with education, poverty alleviation, and rehabilitation.

Human rights perspective treats child labour as denial of dignity and development.

Thus, law is necessary but insufficient without governance and social support.

5) Case laws (5)

M.C. Mehta v. State of Tamil Nadu (1996), (1996) 6 SCC 756 : AIR 1997 SC 699.

Bachpan Bachao Andolan v. Union of India (2011), (2011) 5 SCC 1.

Lakshmi Kant Pandey v. Union of India (1984), (1984) 2 SCC 244 (child welfare approach).

6) Conclusion

The 2016 amendment strengthened prohibition by banning child employment broadly and restricting adolescent hazardous work.

Criticisms focus on family enterprise exceptions and enforcement weaknesses.

Real abolition needs legal enforcement + education + rehabilitation.

Q8) Critically analyse CLRA Act 1970; absorption/sham contract labour; evaluate working today.
1) Synopsis

The CLRA Act regulates contract labour through registration, licensing, welfare, and abolition power, aiming to prevent exploitation. Judicial trends evolved from “automatic absorption” claims to a rule that abolition does not by itself create absorption, but sham contracts can be pierced.

2) Introduction

Contract labour is economically prevalent but legally risky due to exploitation potential.

CLRA balances flexibility with worker welfare through regulation and abolition mechanism.

Key controversy: whether abolition implies absorption by principal employer.

3) Laws/Statutes

Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act, 1970: registration, licensing, welfare provisions; abolition under Section 10.

Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 (disputes/regularisation context).

Constitutional backdrop: Articles 21, 23, 38, 39(e).

4) Answer body

The Act applies where threshold number of contract workers is met and requires principal employer registration and contractor licensing.

It mandates welfare: canteens, rest rooms, drinking water, latrines, first aid—preventing sub-human work conditions.

Section 10 empowers appropriate Government to prohibit contract labour in processes where it is perennial/necessary and where regular employment is feasible.

Early judicial approach sometimes supported absorption where abolition occurred to prevent unfairness.

Later, the Supreme Court clarified that abolition does not automatically absorb workers; remedies lie via industrial adjudication where appropriate.

However, when contract is a camouflage/sham, courts can treat workers as direct employees of principal employer based on control/supervision reality.

Determination relies on tests: who appoints, who pays, who controls discipline and work, integration with establishment.

Contemporary evaluation: outsourcing is widespread, making enforcement difficult; licensing/registration non-compliance remains common.

Digital platforms and fragmented supply chains create new forms of “contract labour-like” work needing legal adaptation.

The Act remains vital to preserve minimum standards and prevent a race to the bottom.

Effective working requires inspections, prosecution, and government willingness to use Section 10 appropriately.

Thus, CLRA is protective in design but challenged by modern labour market structures.

5) Case laws (5)

Air India Statutory Corporation v. United Labour Union (1997), (1997) 9 SCC 377.

Steel Authority of India Ltd. v. National Union Waterfront Workers (2001), (2001) 7 SCC 1.

Dena Nath v. National Fertilizers Ltd. (1992), (1992) 1 SCC 695.

Gujarat Electricity Board v. Hind Mazdoor Sabha (1995), (1995) 5 SCC 27.

People’s Union for Democratic Rights v. Union of India (1982), (1982) 3 SCC 235 (contract labour exploitation context).

6) Conclusion

CLRA’s core is regulation + abolition to prevent exploitation while permitting limited contracting.

The absorption debate is settled towards no automatic absorption, but sham contracts are judicially penetrable.

The Act’s success depends on enforcement intensity and policy responsiveness to new labour forms.

Q9) Reasons for child labour; competing views; constitutional + legal protection from human rights perspective.
1) Synopsis

Child labour persists due to poverty, informality, lack of schooling access, and employer demand for cheap compliant labour. Human rights and constitutionalism demand abolition through prohibition, education, rehabilitation, and social security.

2) Introduction

Child labour is both an economic and rights problem.

Competing views often pit “family survival” against “child development and dignity.”

Indian constitutional and statutory law adopts a protective and reformative approach.

3) Laws/Statutes

Constitution: Articles 24, 21A, 39(f), 45, 46.

Child Labour Act (1986/2016).

RTE Act 2009 (education as right).

Juvenile Justice Act (child protection and rehabilitation).

4) Answer body

Major drivers: poverty, debt, migration, informal sector, low adult wages, and poor enforcement.

Employer incentives: low cost, high control, low bargaining power, and weak inspection.

Social factors: caste vulnerability, trafficking, family breakdown, and lack of awareness.

Competing argument: “regulated child work helps families”; counter: it entrenches poverty and violates development rights.

Human rights perspective treats child labour as denial of dignity, education, health, and future autonomy.

Constitution prohibits exploitation (Art 24) and mandates educational and developmental protection (Art 21A, 39(f), 45).

Statutes prohibit child employment and restrict adolescent hazardous work; penalties deter exploitation.

Courts have ordered rescue, rehabilitation, compensation funds, and monitoring mechanisms.

Effective abolition requires adult wage security and social protection so that families don’t rely on child income.

Rehabilitation must include schooling, counselling, vocational training (where age-appropriate), and family support.

Enforcement must target supply chains, contractors, and traffickers, not merely parents.

Thus, abolition is feasible only through integrated legal + social policy action.

5) Case laws (5)

M.C. Mehta v. State of Tamil Nadu (1996), (1996) 6 SCC 756.

Bachpan Bachao Andolan v. Union of India (2011), (2011) 5 SCC 1.

Bandhua Mukti Morcha v. Union of India (1984), (1984) 3 SCC 161.

People’s Union for Democratic Rights v. Union of India (1982), (1982) 3 SCC 235.

Unni Krishnan v. State of A.P. (1993), (1993) 1 SCC 645 (education as right precursor).

6) Conclusion

Child labour is structurally produced by poverty and weak enforcement, but constitutionally unacceptable.

Law must prioritise education, prohibition, rehabilitation, and family social security.

A human-rights lens demands zero tolerance for exploitation and a strong welfare response.
