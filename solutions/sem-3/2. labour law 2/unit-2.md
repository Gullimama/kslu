Q4) Define wages; explain theories/kinds; discuss Minimum Wages Act: fixation + regulation.
1) Synopsis

“Wages” represent remuneration for employment, and wage theories explain wage determination from subsistence to bargaining/productivity perspectives. The Minimum Wages Act, 1948 prevents exploitation by fixing a statutory floor wage and regulating payment, hours, and conditions.

2) Introduction

Wages are central to industrial justice as they ensure basic livelihood of workers.

Minimum wage is a non-negotiable statutory minimum, not charity.

The Act reflects welfare constitutionalism and is interpreted as beneficial legislation.

3) Laws/Statutes

Minimum Wages Act, 1948: Sections 2 (definitions), 3 (fixing), 4 (components), 5 (procedure), 13–14 (hours/overtime).

Constitution: Articles 23 and 43 (living wage mandate).

Payment of Wages Act, 1936 (contextual linkage—timely payment discipline).

4) Answer body

Wages = all remuneration capable of being expressed in money for work done under employment.

Theories: (i) Subsistence theory (bare minimum survival), (ii) Standard of living theory, (iii) Marginal productivity, (iv) Bargaining theory, (v) Social wage/welfare approach (State intervention).

Kinds of wages: minimum wage, fair wage, living wage; time wage/piece wage; basic + DA; gross vs net.

The Act empowers appropriate Government to fix and revise minimum wages for scheduled employments.

Fixation can be by committee method or notification method (Section 5).

Minimum wage may include basic + special allowance (DA/VDA) + cash value of concessions (Section 4).

The Act mandates periodic revision, reflecting cost of living and preventing wage erosion.

Section 13 allows Government to fix hours of work, rest day, and payment for rest day.

Section 14 ensures overtime at a higher rate where applicable.

Compliance is enforceable through inspectors/claims authority, penalties and recovery mechanisms.

Courts stress that minimum wage is a statutory obligation regardless of employer’s capacity.

Non-payment can implicate constitutional anti-forced labour reasoning where labour is extracted below minimum standards.

5) Case laws (5)

Bijay Cotton Mills Ltd. v. State of Ajmer (1955), AIR 1955 SC 33 (validity of minimum wages).

Chandra Bhavan Boarding & Lodging v. State of Mysore (1969), (1969) 3 SCC 84.

People’s Union for Democratic Rights v. Union of India (1982), (1982) 3 SCC 235.

Airfreight Ltd. v. State of Karnataka (1999), (1999) 6 SCC 567.

Unichoyi v. State of Kerala (1962), AIR 1962 SC 12 (minimum wage principle).

6) Conclusion

Wage theory explains “why wages differ,” but minimum wage law sets the non-negotiable floor.

The Minimum Wages Act operationalises constitutional social justice by preventing exploitation.

Exam focus: definitions + fixation methods + components + hours/overtime + case law.

Q5) Bonus: concept as share in profits; analyse Payment of Bonus Act, 1965 with judicial interpretations + constitutionality/exemption.
1) Synopsis

Bonus historically evolved from profit-sharing/customary practice into a statutory entitlement balancing labour’s claim and industrial viability. The Bonus Act, 1965 standardises eligibility, computation, minimum/maximum bonus, and grants Government power to exempt in public interest.

2) Introduction

Bonus is not pure charity; it is tied to industrial peace and distributive justice.

The Act replaced uncertain industrial adjudication with a uniform statutory scheme.

Constitutionality issues arise around delegation/exemption and retrospective application.

3) Laws/Statutes

Payment of Bonus Act, 1965: eligibility, minimum/maximum bonus, computation, set-on/set-off; Section 36 (exemption).

Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 (bonus as industrial dispute historically).

Constitution: Articles 14/19(1)(g) (reasonableness), welfare orientation.

4) Answer body

Bonus theory: (i) profit-sharing, (ii) deferred wage, (iii) incentive/productivity, (iv) customary/contractual bonus.

The key controversy: is bonus an implied term of contract or an additional statutory/social justice claim? The Act resolves this by statutory entitlement subject to conditions.

The Act applies to establishments meeting statutory criteria and defines “salary/wage”, “employee”, “accounting year”, “allocable surplus”.

It prescribes minimum bonus even if allocable surplus is low (subject to statutory conditions).

It provides maximum cap to maintain balance and predictability.

Set-on/set-off smoothens bonus payments across years, preventing volatility.

Customary/contractual bonus may survive depending on nature and statutory framework; litigation often turns on classification.

Government’s power to exempt is justified as policy discretion, but must be non-arbitrary and in public interest.

Judicial scrutiny has examined excessive delegation and constitutionality of certain provisions.

The Act aims at industrial harmony, preventing recurrent disputes on bonus demands.

Exam advantage: clearly distinguish statutory bonus vs customary bonus vs ex-gratia.

Critical note: compliance challenges remain in small/fragmented sectors; enforcement depends on records and inspection.

5) Case laws (5)

Jalan Trading Co. (P) Ltd. v. Mill Mazdoor Sabha (1967), (1967) 1 SCR 15 : AIR 1967 SC 691.

Sanghvi Jeevraj Ghewar Chand v. Secretary, Madras Chillies… (1969), AIR 1969 SC 530 : (1969) 1 SCR 366.

Mumbai Kamgar Sabha v. Abdulbhai Faizullabhai (1976), (1976) 3 SCC 832 : AIR 1976 SC 1455.

Hukumchand Jute Mills Ltd. v. Second Industrial Tribunal (1979) (customary bonus and Bonus Act interface).

Workmen of Metro Theatre Ltd. v. Metro Theatre Ltd. (1981) (bonus principle; Supreme Court).

6) Conclusion

Bonus shifted from uncertain adjudication to a structured statutory right.

The Act balances labour’s distributive claim with economic stability through caps and set-on/set-off.

Constitutionality debates mainly concern delegation/exemption, but welfare purpose supports validity.

Q6) Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972: payment, determination, authorities + leading case laws.
1) Synopsis

Gratuity is a statutory terminal benefit recognising long and continuous service, payable on retirement, resignation, death, or disablement. The 1972 Act creates an enforceable mechanism through Controlling Authority for determination, recovery, and dispute resolution.

2) Introduction

Gratuity is treated as a right, not a mere employer “good gesture”.

It rewards continuity, loyalty, and social security at the end of service.

The Act is beneficial legislation and is interpreted to advance worker protection.

3) Laws/Statutes

Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972: Sections 4 (entitlement & computation), 7 (determination), 8 (recovery).

Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 (overlap issues historically).

Constitutional backdrop: Articles 41, 43 (social security and living wage ideals).

4) Answer body

The Act applies to notified establishments and defines employee, employer, wages, continuous service.

Gratuity becomes payable on termination after prescribed service, with exceptions for death/disablement.

Quantum: computed as per statutory formula based on last drawn wages and completed years of service (and part thereof rules).

Employer must determine and pay gratuity within time; delay attracts interest subject to statutory conditions.

Disputes on eligibility/amount go to the Controlling Authority; appeal lies to appellate authority.

Section 8 provides for recovery as arrears of land revenue—strong enforcement.

Forfeiture is limited to statutory grounds (misconduct causing loss, riotous conduct, moral turpitude etc.) and is strictly construed.

Courts clarify coverage questions: e.g., whether certain categories (teachers, etc.) fall within definition, and effect of amendments.

Jurisdictional clarity: claims should proceed under the Act’s special mechanism rather than general recovery forums.

The Act strengthens terminal social security and reduces post-employment vulnerability.

Critical points: interpretation of “continuous service,” ceiling limits, and admissible wage components.

Exam scoring: write authorities + procedure + formula + recovery mechanism.

5) Case laws (5)

State of Punjab v. Labour Court, Jullundur (1979/1980), (1980) 4 SCC 4 : AIR 1979 SC 1981.

Ahmedabad Pvt. Primary Teachers’ Assn. v. Administrative Officer (2004), (2004) 1 SCC 755.

Y.K. Singla v. Punjab National Bank (2013) (interest/retiral benefits—gratuity aspect).

Municipal Corporation of Delhi v. Dharam Prakash Sharma (1998) (gratuity recovery principles; Supreme Court).

6) Conclusion

Gratuity is a statutory, enforceable social security right for terminal protection.

The Act’s strength lies in time-bound determination + controlling authority + recovery powers.

Courts generally interpret it to advance worker welfare while allowing limited forfeiture in proved misconduct cases.
