Q1) Discuss the constitutional provisions relating to labour welfare and protection. Explain how the Constitution provides for protection of labour rights.
1) Synopsis (2 sentences)

The Constitution of India embeds labour protection through Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles, creating a welfare framework for humane work, equality, and social security. Courts have expanded these provisions to treat non-payment of minimum wages/forced labour and denial of dignity at work as constitutional violations.

2) Introduction (3 points)

Labour welfare is a constitutional commitment flowing from India’s character as a welfare State.

The Constitution protects labour both negatively (prohibiting exploitation) and positively (mandating social justice and welfare measures).

Judicial interpretation links labour rights to Article 21 (dignity/right to health and livelihood) and Article 23 (forced labour).

3) Laws/Statutes (3–4)

Article 14, 15, 16 – Equality and non-discrimination in employment.

Article 19(1)(g) – Freedom of trade/business subject to reasonable restrictions for labour welfare.

Article 21, 23, 24 – Right to life/dignity, prohibition of forced labour, prohibition of child labour in factories/hazardous work.

DPSPs: Articles 38, 39(e)(f), 41, 42, 43, 43A, 46 – Social order, protection of health/strength of workers, maternity relief, living wage, workers’ participation, protection of weaker sections.

4) Answer body (10–12 points)

The Constitution constitutionalises social justice: labour is not merely contractual; it is a welfare subject.

Article 23 operates against State and private persons; compelling labour by paying less than minimum wage can fall within “forced labour” reasoning.

Article 24 protects children from hazardous employment, reinforcing State duty to prevent exploitation.

Article 21 is interpreted to include dignity, health, humane conditions, and livelihood—forming the rights-basis of labour welfare.

Articles 14–16 ensure equality in recruitment, conditions of service, and public employment; they also support “equal pay for equal work” jurisprudence (read with Article 39(d)).

DPSPs (especially 39(e)(f), 41, 42, 43) create a positive mandate: living wage, decent standard of life, maternity relief, and social security.

Article 43A signals modern industrial relations—participation of workers in management, strengthening workplace democracy.

Courts treat labour welfare laws as beneficial legislation requiring liberal interpretation to achieve constitutional objectives.

Constitutional provisions justify minimum wage fixation, safety laws, social insurance (PF/ESI), maternity benefits, and anti-bonded labour measures.

The State’s obligation is not only to legislate but to implement and enforce labour standards through inspections, penalties, and rehabilitation.

Thus, labour rights become enforceable via writ jurisdiction where exploitation/forced labour/dignity violations occur.

Overall, the Constitution provides a rights + duties architecture: enforceable FRs + guiding DPSPs + judicial expansion.

5) Case laws (5 with year & citation)

People’s Union for Democratic Rights v. Union of India (1982), (1982) 3 SCC 235.

Bandhua Mukti Morcha v. Union of India (1984), (1984) 3 SCC 161.

Olga Tellis v. Bombay Municipal Corporation (1985), 1985 SCC (3) 545.

Consumer Education & Research Centre v. Union of India (1995), 1995 SCC (3) 42.

M.C. Mehta v. State of Tamil Nadu (1996), (1996) 6 SCC 756.

6) Conclusion (3 points)

Labour welfare in India is constitutionally anchored in FRs and DPSPs.

Courts have strengthened labour rights by reading them into dignity, health, livelihood, and anti-exploitation guarantees.

Hence, labour legislation is the statutory expression of constitutional social justice.

Q2) Examine the Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976. Discuss abolition + rehabilitation with case laws.
1) Synopsis

The 1976 Act abolishes bonded labour by extinguishing bonded debt, cancelling bonded obligations, and penalising enforcement. It also imposes a State duty to identify, release, and rehabilitate bonded labourers consistent with Articles 21 and 23.

2) Introduction

Bonded labour is a constitutional wrong (forced labour) prohibited by Article 23.

The Act is a social reform law targeting debt-bondage, customary servitude, and coercive labour.

Rehabilitation is central: abolition without restoration of dignity and livelihood defeats the Act’s purpose.

3) Laws/Statutes

Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976: abolition, extinguishment of debt, vigilance committees, offences.

Constitution: Articles 21 (dignity), 23 (forced labour), 46 (weaker sections).

CrPC/IPC interface: prosecution for wrongful confinement/assault etc. where applicable.

4) Answer body

The Act defines “bonded labour system” to capture arrangements where labour is rendered due to debt/advance/consideration with loss of freedom and/or inadequate wages.

It abolishes the bonded labour system and declares it illegal, making any enforcement void.

All bonded debts are deemed extinguished, and no suit or proceeding for recovery survives.

Any property of bonded labourer taken away is protected; restitution is supported by the Act’s overriding effect.

The Act creates implementing machinery: District Magistrate as enforcing authority and Vigilance Committees for identification and relief.

“Release” is not merely formal; administration must ensure actual freedom from coercion.

The Act provides penalties for compelling bonded labour, advancing bonded debt, or obstructing enforcement.

Rehabilitation measures (often via State schemes) are treated as integral to restoring dignity and livelihood.

Courts in PILs have directed surveys, release certificates, prosecution, and rehabilitation, treating bonded labour as a continuing constitutional violation.

Enforcement is linked to minimum wages, land rights, and social welfare benefits to prevent re-bondage.

The Act is interpreted beneficially, shifting focus from form of contract to real economic compulsion.

Thus, abolition + rehabilitation operate as a combined constitutional remedy to forced labour.

5) Case laws (5)

Bandhua Mukti Morcha v. Union of India (1984), (1984) 3 SCC 161.

Neeraja Chaudhary v. State of M.P. (1984), (1984) 3 SCC 243 (rehabilitation obligation).

P. Sivaswamy v. State of A.P. (1988), (1988) 4 SCC 466.

People’s Union for Democratic Rights v. Union of India (1982), (1982) 3 SCC 235.

Sanjit Roy v. State of Rajasthan (1983), (1983) 1 SCC 525 (forced labour/minimum wage principle).

6) Conclusion

The 1976 Act constitutionally operationalises Article 23 by abolishing debt-bondage.

Courts insist on effective enforcement + rehabilitation as part of the right to dignity.

Sustainable rehabilitation is the only practical prevention against re-bondage.

Q3) Critically analyse the POSH Act, 2013. Discuss ICC role.
1) Synopsis

The POSH Act, 2013 creates a statutory framework to prevent and redress sexual harassment at workplace by imposing employer duties and establishing the Internal Complaints Committee (ICC). ICC is the institutional mechanism for inquiry, interim relief, confidentiality, and corrective action, ensuring safe and equal workplaces.

2) Introduction

Sexual harassment violates equality and dignity, engaging Articles 14, 15, 21.

The Act codifies Vishaka principles and provides enforceable procedures.

ICC operationalises prevention and redressal within the organisation.

3) Laws/Statutes

Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013.

Constitution: Articles 14, 15, 19(1)(g), 21.

Service rules/Standing Orders: misconduct inquiry linkage; principles of natural justice.

4) Answer body

The Act gives an expanded meaning of “workplace” and defines sexual harassment broadly (physical, verbal, non-verbal).

It imposes a positive duty on employers: policy, awareness, safe environment, and assistance to aggrieved women.

ICC composition ensures impartiality: Presiding Officer (woman), internal members, and external member to reduce bias.

ICC has powers akin to inquiry: receiving complaint, conciliation (without monetary settlement), and conducting inquiry.

ICC can recommend interim measures (transfer, leave, restraining contact) to prevent retaliation.

The Act mandates confidentiality, protecting parties and process integrity.

Time-bound procedure improves access to justice and reduces institutional delay.

Employer non-compliance attracts penalties, including repeat violations affecting licensing/registration (as applicable).

Critically, challenges include under-reporting, power imbalance, and poor compliance—hence strong emphasis on training and audit.

ICC must follow natural justice while avoiding re-victimisation; sensitivity is integral to fairness.

The Act integrates workplace equality with human rights and enables civil-like remedy within organisational structure.

Overall, ICC is the statutory pivot transforming constitutional equality into workplace governance.

5) Case laws (5)

Vishaka v. State of Rajasthan (1997), (1997) 6 SCC 241.

Apparel Export Promotion Council v. A.K. Chopra (1999), (1999) 1 SCC 759.

Medha Kotwal Lele v. Union of India (2013), (2013) 1 SCC 297 (implementation of Vishaka).

Aureliano Fernandes v. State of Goa (2023), (2023) 9 SCC 631 (compliance/ICC enforcement).

Punjab Sind Bank v. Durgesh Kuwar (2020), (2020) 15 SCC 540 (disciplinary action/sexual harassment).

6) Conclusion

POSH converts constitutional dignity and equality into a workplace enforcement statute.

ICC is the core compliance and justice delivery institution under the Act.

Strong implementation + culture of prevention determines the Act’s real effectiveness.
