Examine the salient features of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015. Discuss the composition, powers and functions of Juvenile Justice Board (JJB) with leading case laws.
1) Synopsis (2 sentences)

The JJ Act, 2015 is a child-centric, rights-based, rehabilitative statute that separates Children in Conflict with Law (CCL) from Children in Need of Care and Protection (CNCP) and creates specialised institutions for inquiry and rehabilitation. The Juvenile Justice Board (JJB) is the key statutory body to conduct child-friendly inquiry, ensure best interests, and pass individualised rehabilitative orders.

2) Introduction (3 points)

Juvenile justice is founded on reformation, reintegration, and restorative outcomes, not retribution.

The 2015 Act strengthens institutional mechanisms (JJB/CWC/SJPU/CCIs) and introduces structured decision-making including preliminary assessment for certain cases.

The Act operationalises constitutional commitments (dignity, equality, child protection) through special procedure and child-friendly safeguards.

3) Laws / Statutes (3–4)

Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 – S. 2(13), 2(14), 2(33) (CCL/CNCP/heinous), S. 4 (JJB composition), S. 8 (powers/functions), S. 14–18 (inquiry & orders), S. 15 (preliminary assessment).

Constitution of India – Art. 14, 15(3), 21, 39(e) & (f), 45, 47 (child welfare & dignity framework).

POCSO Act, 2012 (interface for child victims; child-centric handling).

Criminal Procedure principles (special law overrides general procedure for child-specific inquiry).

4) Answer Body (10–12 points)

Core classification: the Act distinctly covers CCL (alleged/ found to have committed offence) and CNCP (vulnerable children needing protection), ensuring different objectives and forums.

Guiding philosophy: the statute is welfare-oriented, emphasising best interests of the child, dignity, non-stigmatisation, confidentiality, and fresh start through reintegration.

Institutional design: the Act mandates specialised bodies—JJB for CCL, CWC for CNCP, SJPU/Child Welfare Police Officer for child-friendly policing, and regulated Child Care Institutions (CCIs).

JJB composition (S.4): a Principal Magistrate (Judicial Magistrate of First Class or equivalent) + two social worker members (including at least one woman), enabling judicial + social expertise in decision-making.

Exclusive jurisdiction: JJB conducts inquiry (not a conventional criminal trial) in a child-friendly manner, ensuring the process is informal, non-adversarial in spirit, and focused on rehabilitation.

Powers/functions (S.8): JJB can take cognizance of matters relating to CCL, ensure legal aid, order social investigation report, supervise rehabilitation plans, and pass appropriate dispositional orders.

Inquiry framework (S.14): inquiry is time-bound, insists on speed + child protection, and relies on social investigation inputs for individualised outcomes.

Preliminary assessment (S.15): for certain cases (typically older children + serious allegations), JJB assesses mental/physical capacity, ability to understand consequences, and circumstances, using expert assistance when required.

Orders (S.18): outcomes focus on care, supervision, counselling, community service, probation-like supervision, or placement in special homes, and only in tightly structured situations can transfer to Children’s Court arise.

Child-friendly safeguards: emphasis on confidentiality, avoidance of stigma, minimal institutionalisation, and rehabilitation through individual care plan and monitored reintegration.

Accountability & implementation: the Act’s effectiveness depends on functional Boards/Committees, trained personnel, registered CCIs, periodic inspections, and robust child-protection infrastructure.

Exam takeaway: JJB is the statutory pivot—rights-protective inquiry + rehabilitative orders + supervision of reintegration, which is the “nyaya” orientation of juvenile justice.

6) Conclusion (3 points)

The JJ Act, 2015 is a rehabilitative, institution-driven framework built on child rights and reintegration.

The JJB’s mixed composition ensures decisions are both legally sound and socially informed, focusing on the child’s reform.

Case law consistently reinforces strict adherence to statutory structure, expert-based assessment where required, and effective implementation.

UNIT 5 – Q2
Discuss the procedure relating to Children in conflict with Law and Children in need of Care and Protection under the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015. Explain the role of Child Welfare Committee (CWC) in rehabilitation of children.
1) Synopsis (2 sentences)

The JJ Act creates two distinct procedural tracks—one for CCL before JJB and another for CNCP before CWC, each with child-friendly safeguards and rehabilitative objectives. The CWC functions as the statutory authority to ensure care, protection, restoration, and rehabilitation through inquiry, orders, and monitoring of institutional/non-institutional care.

2) Introduction (3 points)

Procedure under the JJ Act is designed as protective inquiry, not punitive prosecution.

The law prioritises family-based restoration and treats institutionalisation as a measure of last resort.

CWC is the frontline decision-maker for CNCP, ensuring immediate safety + long-term rehabilitation.

3) Laws / Statutes (3–4)

JJ Act, 2015 – S. 10 (apprehension/production of CCL), S. 12 (bail to child), S. 14–18 (inquiry & orders), S. 15 (preliminary assessment), S. 27 (CWC), S. 31–36 (procedure for CNCP), S. 39 (restoration/rehabilitation).

Constitution – Art. 21, 39(f) (dignity and protection of childhood).

POCSO Act (child victims interface; coordination with JJ protection mechanisms).

General criminal procedure principle: special child procedure overrides ordinary adversarial trial model.

4) Answer Body (10–12 points)

CCL entry point: a child alleged to have committed offence must be apprehended/handled child-friendly and produced before JJB promptly as per statutory scheme.

Bail principle (S.12): bail is the rule for children, subject to statutory exceptions; emphasis remains on non-custodial handling and safe placement.

Inquiry by JJB (S.14): JJB conducts a structured inquiry supported by social investigation report and individual care plan, focusing on circumstances and rehabilitation needs.

Orders for CCL (S.18): outcomes are rehabilitative and proportionate, including counselling, community service, supervision, special home placement, etc., instead of conventional sentencing.

Preliminary assessment (S.15): where applicable, assessment must be reasoned, expert-assisted, and legally structured—ensuring capacity + consequences + circumstances are evaluated.

CNCP production (S.31): CNCP may be produced before CWC by police, public servants, childline, or any responsible person, ensuring immediate protective jurisdiction.

CWC inquiry (S.36): CWC conducts inquiry to determine CNCP status and appropriate measures, maintaining child safety, dignity, confidentiality, and best interests.

Rehabilitation pathway: CWC can order restoration to family, foster care, sponsorship, adoption-linked processes where appropriate, or institutional placement with monitoring.

CWC’s rehabilitation role: CWC coordinates with District Child Protection Unit/CCIs, ensures individual care plans, education, health, counselling, and protection from abuse/trafficking.

Interface with victim-children: child victims of sexual offences/abuse may require CNCP protections; JJ framework ensures care + protection mechanisms operate alongside criminal process.

Monitoring & accountability: robust rehabilitation depends on registered CCIs, trained staff, inspections, and timely orders—courts have repeatedly pushed for compliance.

Exam takeaway: the Act replaces punishment-centric approach with two specialised procedures—JJB for CCL and CWC for CNCP—both aimed at restoration and reintegration.

5) Case Laws (5 with year & reference)

Re: Exploitation of Children in Orphanages in the State of Tamil Nadu v. Union of India, [2017] 4 SCR 625 (WP (Crl.) No. 102/2007) – CNCP interpretation + enforcement of protection/rehab infrastructure.

Sampurna Behura v. Union of India, (2018) 4 SCC 433 (WP (C) No. 473/2005) – directions on functional CWCs/JJBs/child-protection systems.

Shilpa Mittal v. State (NCT of Delhi), Criminal Appeal No. 34 of 2020 (SC, 09-01-2020) – classification impacting S.15 route.

Barun Chandra Thakur v. Master Bholu, Criminal Appeal No. 950 of 2022 (SC, 13-07-2022) – proper method/standards for preliminary assessment.

6) Conclusion (3 points)

The JJ Act creates a dual-track procedure: JJB for CCL and CWC for CNCP, each designed to be protective and rehabilitative.

CWC is central to immediate care + long-term rehabilitation, preferring restoration and non-institutional care where feasible.

Judicial directions repeatedly emphasise effective implementation, trained institutions, and child-centric outcomes.

UNIT 5 – Q3
Critically analyse the Probation of Offenders Act, 1958. Discuss the power of Court to release certain offenders on probation/good conduct and to require released offenders to pay compensation and cost; Appeal and Revision with relevant judicial pronouncements.
1) Synopsis (2 sentences)

The Probation of Offenders Act, 1958 embodies reformative sentencing, allowing courts to substitute incarceration with release after admonition or probation of good conduct when imprisonment is not necessary. It also empowers courts to impose compensation/cost conditions and provides a structured framework for reports, supervision, and appellate control.

2) Introduction (3 points)

Probation is rooted in the modern penological aim of reformation over retribution, especially for first-time/low-risk offenders.

The Act creates a statutory mechanism of conditional liberty, supervised behaviour, and corrective counselling through probation officers.

Courts must apply the Act with reasoned discretion, balancing societal interest, victim impact, and offender reformation.

3) Laws / Statutes (3–4)

Probation of Offenders Act, 1958 – S.3 (release after admonition), S.4 (probation of good conduct), S.5 (compensation & costs), S.6 (special reasons for <21), S.11 (appeal & revision), S.12 (no disqualification in certain cases).

CrPC principle – release on probation also reflected in general criminal procedure; where POA applies, it is the special rehabilitative regime.

IPC sentencing structure (probation operates “instead of sentencing at once” where legally permitted).

Constitutional values (fairness, proportionality in sentencing under Art. 21).

4) Answer Body (10–12 points)

Object & policy: the Act aims to prevent offenders from becoming hardened criminals by avoiding prison exposure and ensuring structured reformation.

S.3 (Admonition): for suitable offences and circumstances, court may release after due admonition, reflecting minimal intervention and immediate corrective warning.

S.4 (Good conduct probation): where offence is not punishable with death/life and the court finds it “expedient,” it may release the offender on executing a bond with conditions to maintain peace and good behaviour.

Judicial discretion under S.4 is not arbitrary; it must consider nature of offence, character of offender, antecedents, circumstances, and social impact, i.e., a reasoned sentencing alternative.

Probation officer report: before granting probation, courts can call for a report to assess suitability; this anchors the decision in social facts, not only legal guilt.

Supervision & conditions: probation order may require supervision, counselling, residence/occupation stability, and compliance—making probation a controlled liberty not a free acquittal.

S.6 (Offenders under 21): statute creates a strong rehabilitative tilt—court should not sentence to imprisonment unless it records reasons why probation/admonition is not desirable.

S.5 (Compensation & costs): court can require the released offender to pay compensation to victim and costs, thus integrating victim-centric restorative element within reformative sentencing.

S.12 (No disqualification): where applicable, conviction does not automatically disqualify the person from certain consequences, reflecting the “fresh start” ideology (subject to statutory limits).

S.11 (Appeal/Revision): the Act provides appellate control; higher courts can examine whether discretion was exercised properly and whether conditions were lawful and proportionate.

Critical analysis: probation is not suitable for all offences—courts deny it where deterrence/public safety demands stricter response (e.g., serious violence/road-death patterns).

Exam takeaway: POA is a sentencing statute converting punishment into structured rehabilitation + victim compensation, requiring speaking orders and judicially controlled discretion.

5) Case Laws (5 with year & reference)

Rattan Lal v. State of Punjab, AIR 1965 SC 444 (decided 10-04-1964) – reformative object; approach to young offenders.

Ishar Das v. State of Punjab, AIR 1972 SC 1295; (1973) 2 SCC 65 – POA can prevail where conditions satisfied; emphasis on probationary policy.

Jugal Kishore Prasad v. State of Bihar, AIR 1972 SC 2522; (1972) 2 SCC 633 – interpretation around S.6 and statutory limits in serious offences.

Dalbir Singh v. State of Haryana, (2000) 5 SCC 82; AIR 2000 SC 1677 – caution against routine probation in certain categories; sentencing proportionality.

Chellammal v. State represented by Inspector of Police, 2025 INSC 540, Criminal Appeal No. 2065 of 2025 – importance of considering probation and recording reasons when omitted.

6) Conclusion (3 points)

The Probation of Offenders Act is a reformative sentencing code that replaces imprisonment with conditional liberty + supervision where justified.

Through S.5 compensation and structured supervision, it blends victim-sensitive restoration with offender reformation.

Judicial precedents insist probation must be granted/denied through reasoned discretion, guided by offender profile, offence gravity, and societal interest.
