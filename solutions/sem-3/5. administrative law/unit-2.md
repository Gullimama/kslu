Legislative Power of Administration; Excessive Delegation; judicial & parliamentary control.

1) Synopsis
Delegated legislation is essential for modern governance but must not cross into essential legislative function. Excessive delegation is controlled through constitutional limits, judicial review, and parliamentary supervision.

2) Introduction

Legislature lays policy; administration fills details and standards.

Delegation is justified by complexity, speed, and expertise.

Control is needed to prevent abdication and arbitrariness.

3) Laws/Statutes

Constitution: Articles 245–246 (legislative power), 14 (non-arbitrariness).

Article 13 (invalid law), 32/226 (review).

Parent/enabling Act + rules/regulations (delegated legislation).

4) Answer body

Legislative power of administration refers to making rules, regulations, bye-laws, orders, notifications under an enabling Act.

The doctrine of excessive delegation prohibits legislature from surrendering essential legislative function, i.e., policy determination.

Valid delegation requires the parent Act to lay down policy, purpose, standards, and guidance.

Delegation may be broad, but must be canalised by objectives, conditions, and procedural safeguards.

Judicial control: courts examine (i) substantive ultra vires (beyond Act/Constitution), (ii) procedural ultra vires (mandatory procedure not followed).

Courts also test delegated legislation for reasonableness, arbitrariness (Art. 14), and conflict with fundamental rights.

Parliamentary control includes laying procedures (simple laying, laying subject to modification, laying subject to annulment).

Parliamentary committees (like Committee on Subordinate Legislation) scrutinise excessive delegation, misuse, and drafting defects.

Publication/notification requirements ensure accessibility and legality.

Delegated legislation is void if it travels beyond the scope or defeats the policy of the enabling Act.

The goal is balance: allow administrative rule-making but prevent legislative abdication.

Thus, delegation is constitutionally valid when it is guided, controlled, and reviewable.

6) Conclusion

Delegated legislation is a necessity of welfare administration.

Excessive delegation is prevented by policy requirement + judicial review + parliamentary scrutiny.

The controlling idea is no abdication, only guided delegation.

UNIT 2 — Q2
Advantages & disadvantages of delegated legislation; exclusion of judicial review.

1) Synopsis
Delegated legislation enables speed and technical regulation but risks over-breadth and misuse. Judicial review is rarely excluded completely; even where statutes attempt exclusion, courts preserve review for ultra vires and constitutional violations.

2) Introduction

Delegation supports efficiency and expertise.

It creates risk of executive law-making without democratic debate.

Hence review and legislative control remain crucial.

3) Laws/Statutes

Constitution: Articles 14, 19, 21; 13; 32/226.

Enabling Act + rules/regulations + laying provisions.

4) Answer body

Advantages: flexibility, speed, ability to address technical details, experimentation, and emergency response.

It reduces legislative burden and allows continuous updating without full parliamentary process.

Disadvantages: weak democratic deliberation, risk of arbitrariness, excessive discretion, and possible conflict with rights.

It may lead to “bureaucratic legislation,” poor drafting, and inadequate publicity.

Judicial review generally applies to ensure delegated legislation remains within parent Act and Constitution.

Exclusion clauses may attempt to bar review, but courts still test for jurisdictional error, mala fides, violation of fundamental rights, and ultra vires.

Subordinate legislation is also tested for manifest arbitrariness/unreasonableness under Article 14.

If mandatory procedure like consultation/publication is prescribed and violated, it becomes procedurally ultra vires.

Even where review is “excluded,” courts interpret exclusion narrowly to protect rule of law.

Parliamentary control through laying and committees is a key safeguard to prevent misuse.

The real principle: delegated legislation is valid only when it is within authority and consistent with constitutional guarantees.

Therefore, “exclusion” cannot become immunity.

5) Case laws

Indian Express Newspapers (1985): 1986 AIR 515; (1985) 1 SCC 641.

In re Delhi Laws Act (1951): AIR 1951 SC 332.

Ajoy Kumar Banerjee (1984): 1984 AIR 1130; (1984) 3 SCC 127.

Avinder Singh (1979): (1979) 1 SCC 137.

E.P. Royappa (1974): 1974 AIR 555; (1974) 4 SCC 3 (Art.14 non-arbitrariness).

6) Conclusion

Delegated legislation is beneficial but inherently risky.

Review cannot be truly excluded for ultra vires/constitutional breach.

Hence controls ensure flexibility without lawlessness.

UNIT 2 — Q3
Administrative directions and legal validity; challenge to delegated legislation with case laws.

1) Synopsis
Administrative directions are executive instructions guiding discretion but cannot override statutes or rules. Delegated legislation can be challenged on constitutional, substantive ultra vires, and procedural ultra vires grounds.

2) Introduction

Directions differ from rules: they are generally non-statutory.

They may bind the department internally but not create enforceable rights against statute.

Courts ensure directions do not become backdoor legislation.

3) Laws/Statutes

Constitution: Articles 73/162 (executive power), 14, 32/226.

Parent Act + rules/regulations (statutory).

4) Answer body

Administrative directions/ instructions/ circulars are issued under executive power to secure uniformity and guide officials.

They are valid when they supplement law and fill gaps, but invalid when they supplant or contradict statute/rules.

Non-statutory directions ordinarily do not have the force of law; they cannot impose burdens contrary to law.

If directions affect rights, they are tested under Article 14 for arbitrariness and under enabling statute limits.

Delegated legislation (rules/regulations) is statutory and has binding force, but remains subordinate to parent Act and Constitution.

Grounds of challenge: lack of power, excess delegation, inconsistency with Act, violation of constitutional rights, unreasonableness, and failure to follow mandatory procedure.

Courts distinguish between policy discretion and legal limits; directions cannot be used to avoid statutory safeguards.

If a rule goes beyond the purpose of Act, it becomes substantively ultra vires.

If required consultation/publication/laying is not followed, it becomes procedurally ultra vires.

Thus, administrative directions are secondary guidance, while delegated legislation is subordinate law, both being reviewable on legality.

The controlling principle remains rule of law: executive cannot legislate by mere circular.

Remedy lies primarily through writ jurisdiction and judicial review.

5) Case laws

Indian Express Newspapers (1985): 1986 AIR 515; (1985) 1 SCC 641 (review of subordinate legislation).

Avinder Singh (1979): (1979) 1 SCC 137 (limits/tests of delegation).

In re Delhi Laws Act (1951): AIR 1951 SC 332 (policy/abdication).

Ajoy Kumar Banerjee (1984): 1984 AIR 1130; (1984) 3 SCC 127.

E.P. Royappa (1974): 1974 AIR 555; (1974) 4 SCC 3 (Art.14).

6) Conclusion

Directions are administrative aids, not substitutes for law.

Delegated legislation is binding but strictly subordinate and reviewable.

Courts enforce legality to prevent executive over-reach.
