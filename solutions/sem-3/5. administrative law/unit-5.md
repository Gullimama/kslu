Control mechanisms over Corporate & Public Undertakings; regulatory framework.

1) Synopsis
Statutory corporations and PSUs are controlled through constitutional discipline, statutory supervision, parliamentary oversight, audit, and judicial review. The key issue is ensuring public undertakings act as “State” instrumentalities with Article 14 fairness.

2) Introduction

Public undertakings perform public functions and manage public resources.

Control is needed to prevent arbitrariness and mismanagement.

Article 12 jurisprudence brings many undertakings under constitutional obligations.

3) Laws/Statutes

Constitution: Articles 12, 14, 226 (amenability to writs).

CAG/Audit framework (constitutional/statutory basis), enabling PSU statutes.

4) Answer body

Control begins with classification of PSU/statutory corporation as “State” under Article 12 if it is instrumentality/agency.

Once within Article 12, actions must meet Article 14 standards of non-arbitrariness and fairness.

Statutory control: parent statute defines powers, duties, rule-making, and governmental directions.

Administrative control: ministry supervision, appointments, directions, and performance monitoring.

Financial control: budgeting, grants, and public finance discipline.

Audit control: CAG audits ensure propriety, efficiency, and legality in spending.

Parliamentary control: questions, debates, PAC/COPE committees, scrutiny of reports, and accountability to legislature.

Judicial control: writs against illegal actions, contractual fairness review where public law element exists.

Transparency and reasoned decision standards reduce arbitrariness in procurement/employment decisions.

Discretion in PSUs must remain structured and policy-consistent.

The framework aims at “public interest management,” not private profit autonomy.

Hence control is multi-layered: constitutional + legislative + executive + audit + judicial.

5) Case laws

Ramana Dayaram Shetty v IAAI (1979): (1979) 3 SCC 489; AIR 1979 SC 1628 (PSU fairness).

Ajay Hasia v Khalid Mujib (1981): (1981) 1 SCC 722 (instrumentality tests).

Pradeep Kumar Biswas v IICB/CSIR (2002): (2002) 5 SCC 111 (Article 12).

Zee Telefilms v Union of India (2005): (2005) 4 SCC 649 (limits of Article 12).

Andi Mukta Sadguru v V.R. Rudani (1989): 1989 AIR 1607; (1989) 2 SCC 691 (writ for public duty).

6) Conclusion

Public undertakings are controlled to ensure public interest accountability.

Article 12/14 discipline ensures non-arbitrariness and fairness.

Combined oversight prevents PSUs from becoming uncontrolled power centres.

UNIT 5 — Q2
Ombudsman in India (Lokpal & Lokayukta); role against deviance, corruption, maladministration.

1) Synopsis
Ombudsman mechanisms institutionalise independent complaint redressal to check corruption and maladministration. Lokpal/Lokayukta strengthen administrative ethics by ensuring investigation, inquiry, and systemic deterrence.

2) Introduction

Corruption is a form of administrative deviance undermining rule of law.

Ombudsman provides accessible remedy outside normal departmental hierarchy.

Accountability improves when oversight is independent and credible.

3) Laws/Statutes

Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act, 2013 (Lokpal framework).

State Lokayukta Acts (state level).

Constitution values: Articles 14, 21 (fair governance), and public law remedies.

4) Answer body

Lokpal is a central ombudsman mechanism to inquire into allegations of corruption against public functionaries within statutory scope.

Lokayuktas operate at state level under respective state enactments, targeting corruption and maladministration.

Their significance lies in independence, improving credibility of anti-corruption action.

Ombudsman helps overcome weaknesses of departmental inquiries—conflict of interest and institutional bias.

They promote administrative discipline by recommending/initiating investigation and ensuring follow-through.

They act as deterrence by increasing probability of detection and sanction.

Their effectiveness depends on resources, functional autonomy, transparency, and coordination with agencies.

They also support systemic reforms by identifying patterns of deviance and suggesting administrative improvements.

Ombudsman contributes to rule of law by checking arbitrary favouritism and abuse of discretion.

They complement judicial review: courts correct illegality; ombudsman improves integrity mechanisms.

However, they must operate within statutory procedure to avoid politicisation.

Overall, Lokpal/Lokayukta are key control mechanisms for clean administration.

5) Case laws (linked to anti-corruption/accountability ecosystem)

Vineet Narain v Union of India (1997): AIR 1998 SC 889; (1998) 1 SCC 226 (institutional anti-corruption reforms/CVC).

E.P. Royappa (1974): 1974 AIR 555; (1974) 4 SCC 3 (anti-arbitrariness).

Ramana Dayaram Shetty (1979): (1979) 3 SCC 489 (fairness in public bodies).

Pradeep Kumar Biswas (2002): (2002) 5 SCC 111 (public bodies under constitutional discipline).

L. Chandra Kumar (1997): (1997) 3 SCC 261 (judicial review as constitutional control backdrop).

6) Conclusion

Ombudsman institutions are designed to ensure clean and accountable administration.

Lokpal/Lokayukta strengthen deterrence and public trust by independent oversight.

Their success depends on autonomy, capacity, and faithful implementation.

UNIT 5 — Q3
Role of CVC, Parliamentary Committees, Commission of Enquiry in accountability and transparency.

1) Synopsis
CVC, parliamentary committees, and commissions of enquiry are key institutional controls ensuring vigilance, legislative oversight, and fact-finding. They promote transparency by subjecting administration to scrutiny, audit, investigation, and public reporting.

2) Introduction

Accountability requires checks beyond courts: preventive + corrective mechanisms.

Vigilance addresses corruption; parliamentary control addresses policy/finance; inquiry commissions address major public issues.

These controls reinforce rule-of-law governance.

3) Laws/Statutes

Central Vigilance Commission Act, 2003 (CVC).

Commissions of Inquiry Act, 1952.

Parliamentary committee system (Rules of Procedure; PAC/COPE etc.).

4) Answer body

CVC functions as apex vigilance institution supervising vigilance administration and strengthening integrity in public services.

It supports preventive vigilance (systems improvement) and punitive vigilance (case monitoring).

Parliamentary committees (PAC, estimates, undertakings committees) ensure executive remains accountable for public expenditure and performance.

PAC uses CAG reports to detect irregularities and insist on corrective action.

Committees act as continuous control mechanisms beyond floor debates and questions.

Commissions of enquiry investigate matters of public importance, establish facts, and recommend reforms.

Though generally recommendatory, enquiry reports shape public accountability and legislative/executive response.

Together these institutions ensure administrative action is not opaque; they enforce answerability.

They complement judicial review: courts decide legality; these bodies ensure systemic integrity.

Transparency increases through reporting, legislative discussion, and corrective directions.

Effectiveness depends on independence, timely action, and implementation of recommendations.

Thus institutional controls form an essential part of administrative law’s “control mechanisms.”

5) Case laws

Vineet Narain v Union of India (1997): AIR 1998 SC 889; (1998) 1 SCC 226 (CVC role/institutional vigilance).

Minerva Mills (1980): AIR 1980 SC 1789; (1980) 3 SCC 625 (constitutional accountability backdrop).

L. Chandra Kumar (1997): (1997) 3 SCC 261 (judicial review framework).

E.P. Royappa (1974): 1974 AIR 555; (1974) 4 SCC 3 (anti-arbitrariness).

Pradeep Kumar Biswas (2002): (2002) 5 SCC 111 (public body accountability).

6) Conclusion

CVC, parliamentary committees, and enquiry commissions are core non-judicial controls.

They strengthen transparency through vigilance, audit-based scrutiny, and public fact-finding.

Together, they ensure administration is answerable, ethical, and rule-of-law compliant.
