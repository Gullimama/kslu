Tests to determine when authority must act judicially; Bias and Audi Alteram Partem with case laws.

1) Synopsis
An authority must act judicially when its decision has civil consequences and the statute/subject-matter implies a duty to act fairly. Natural justice rests mainly on no-bias (nemo judex) and hearing (audi alteram partem).

2) Introduction

Modern administrative decisions often decide rights, status, and property.

The line between administrative and quasi-judicial has narrowed into a duty to act fairly.

Bias and denial of hearing strike at the validity of the decision.

3) Laws/Statutes

Constitution: Articles 14 & 21 (fairness), 226/32.

Statutes conferring adjudicatory powers; procedural rules.

4) Answer body

The classic approach asked whether statute required a “duty to act judicially”; modern approach emphasises civil consequences and fairness.

Where decision affects rights/legitimate interests, authority must follow fair procedure even if not a court.

Bias doctrine: decision-maker must be impartial; justice must appear to be done.

Types: personal bias, pecuniary bias, subject-matter bias, departmental/official bias; test is real likelihood/ reasonable apprehension.

Even participation creating reasonable suspicion vitiates the decision; waiver may apply only where fully informed.

Audi alteram partem requires notice, disclosure of material, opportunity to represent, and reasonable hearing.

Hearing may include cross-examination where credibility is central; at least, affected person must have meaningful opportunity.

Post-decisional hearing may not cure where pre-decisional hearing is essential, except in limited circumstances.

Natural justice is flexible; the content varies with context but cannot be reduced to empty formality.

Courts quash decisions for bias/denial of hearing as procedural ultra vires and violation of fairness under Articles 14/21.

Thus, administrative justice must be fair, unbiased, and participatory.

Natural justice remains the core control for administrative adjudication.

5) Case laws

Province of Bombay v Khushaldas Advani (1950): AIR 1950 SC 222 (quasi-judicial test).

A.K. Kraipak v Union of India (1969): AIR 1970 SC 150 (administrative + natural justice).

Manak Lal v Dr Prem Chand (1957): 1957 AIR 425 (bias).

Gullapalli Nageswara Rao v APSRTC (1959): AIR 1959 SC 308 (bias/hearing).

Maneka Gandhi v Union of India (1978): (1978) 1 SCC 248 (fair procedure/audi).

6) Conclusion

Where civil consequences arise, authorities must act fairly.

Bias and denial of hearing destroy procedural legitimacy.

Hence natural justice is the minimum standard of administrative adjudication.

UNIT 3 — Q2
Reasoned decision; exceptions to natural justice; effect of non-compliance.

1) Synopsis
A reasoned (speaking) order is the heartbeat of fairness, enabling transparency and judicial review. Natural justice may be excluded only by express words/necessary implication, but exclusion is read narrowly.

2) Introduction

Reasons prevent arbitrariness and promote accountability.

Exceptions exist for urgency, confidentiality, national security, etc.

Non-compliance generally vitiates the decision unless harmless.

3) Laws/Statutes

Constitution: Articles 14, 21; 226/32.

Statutory provisions excluding hearing (e.g., security/emergency) where applicable.

4) Answer body

A reasoned order shows application of mind and restrains arbitrary discretion.

Reasons allow the affected party to know “why” and enable effective appeal/review.

Recording reasons is integral especially in quasi-judicial decisions.

Natural justice exceptions: (i) express statutory exclusion, (ii) necessity/urgency, (iii) confidentiality/security, (iv) impracticability, (v) legislative action.

Even where excluded, courts insist on minimum fairness compatible with situation.

If statute excludes, courts test if exclusion is constitutionally valid and whether action is still non-arbitrary.

Effect of violation: order is normally void/voidable and liable to be quashed by certiorari.

However, courts examine prejudice; yet where action is inherently unfair, prejudice is presumed.

Post-decisional hearing is not a universal cure; it may be inadequate where pre-hearing is essential.

Non-compliance also violates Article 14’s non-arbitrariness principle and Article 21’s fairness content.

Therefore, speaking orders + natural justice ensure legality, fairness, and reviewability.

Administrative adjudication without reasons/hearing becomes administrative fiat and is invalid.

5) Case laws

Siemens Engg. v Union of India (1976): AIR 1976 SC 1785; (1976) 2 SCC 981 (reasons mandatory).

S.L. Kapoor v Jagmohan (1980): 1981 AIR 136; (1980) 4 SCC 379 (violation vitiates).

Union of India v Tulsiram Patel (1985): 1985 AIR 1416; (1985) 3 SCC 398 (exceptions).

Swadeshi Cotton Mills v Union of India (1981): AIR 1981 SC 818; (1981) 1 SCC 664 (pre-decisional hearing).

Mohinder Singh Gill v CEC (1978): 1978 AIR 851; (1978) 1 SCC 405 (reasons/validity).

6) Conclusion

Reasons are essential to fairness and review.

Natural justice exceptions are narrow and contextual, never blanket immunity.

Violation usually vitiates decisions and invites judicial correction.

UNIT 3 — Q3
Grounds to challenge quasi-judicial decision before Supreme Court; evolution of natural justice.

1) Synopsis
Quasi-judicial decisions are challengeable for jurisdictional error, procedural unfairness, illegality, and irrationality. Natural justice has evolved from rigid “duty to act judicially” to a broader duty to act fairly.

2) Introduction

Supreme Court’s control flows through Articles 32 and 136 (and constitutional review).

Natural justice is a dynamic doctrine ensuring fair process.

Judicial review focuses on decision-making process, not merits.

3) Laws/Statutes

Constitution: Articles 32, 136, 226/227 (in principle), 14, 21.

Statutes establishing tribunals/authorities.

4) Answer body

Grounds include lack/excess of jurisdiction, acting beyond statutory power, or failure to exercise jurisdiction.

Error of law apparent, misconstruction of statute affecting jurisdiction.

Violation of natural justice: bias, no notice/hearing, denial of materials, unfair procedure.

Mala fides and colourable exercise of power.

Consideration of irrelevant factors or ignoring relevant considerations.

Unreasonableness/irrationality (manifest arbitrariness; Wednesbury-type control in Indian form).

Non-speaking order where reasons are required; absence of reasons frustrates review.

Disproportionality in appropriate contexts (especially penalties) as part of judicial review.

Evolution: from Khushaldas Advani’s approach to Kraipak’s “fairness” model, expanding natural justice to administrative decisions with civil consequences.

Article 14’s non-arbitrariness strengthened this evolution; fairness became a constitutional expectation.

Supreme Court intervenes to preserve rule of law and constitutional governance.

Remedy may be quashing, remand, or directions ensuring fresh decision by lawful process.

5) Case laws

A.K. Kraipak (1969): AIR 1970 SC 150.

State of U.P. v Mohammad Nooh (1958): 1958 AIR 86; 1958 SCR 595 (certiorari/procedural illegality).

S.L. Kapoor (1980): 1981 AIR 136; (1980) 4 SCC 379.

Siemens Engg. (1976): AIR 1976 SC 1785; (1976) 2 SCC 981.

Om Kumar v Union of India (2001): AIR 2000 SC 3689; (2001) 2 SCC 386 (proportionality review).

6) Conclusion

Supreme Court control ensures quasi-judicial bodies remain within law and fairness.

Natural justice has broadened into a general duty of fair administrative procedure.

Judicial review thereby protects rule of law without substituting administrative merits.
