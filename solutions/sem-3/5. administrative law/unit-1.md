Define Administrative Law and explain its nature and scope. Discuss the impact and implications of Separation of Powers and Rule of Law on Administrative Law.

1) Synopsis (2 sentences)
Administrative Law regulates the organisation, powers, functions, and control of administrative authorities and provides remedies against abuse of power. Separation of powers and rule of law shape administrative law by insisting on limited government, legality, fairness, and judicial review.

2) Introduction (3 points)

Modern welfare State requires wide administrative action, making control of discretion essential.

Administrative law balances administrative efficiency with liberty and legality.

It operationalises constitutional values like non-arbitrariness, fairness, and accountability.

3) Laws/Statutes (3–4)

Constitution of India: Articles 14, 19, 21 (substantive limits), Articles 32, 226 (remedies).

Article 13 (invalidity of law inconsistent with fundamental rights).

Doctrine of Basic Structure (judicial review, rule of law).

4) Answer body (10–12 points/sentences)

Administrative Law is the law relating to public administration—it governs rule-making, adjudication, and executive action by authorities.

Its nature is public law: it controls public power and insists that power be exercised for authorised purposes.

Scope includes (i) administrative organisation, (ii) delegated legislation, (iii) administrative adjudication, (iv) discretion, and (v) judicial and other remedies.

It is not codified as one statute; it is built through Constitution + statutes + judge-made principles (ultra vires, natural justice, reasonableness).

Separation of powers in India is functional, not rigid: yet it requires that each organ act within its constitutional domain, preventing “administrative absolutism.”

Delegated legislation is permitted because legislature cannot handle all details, but separation of powers demands policy in parent Act and controls over the delegate.

When administration performs adjudicatory functions, separation of powers requires procedural fairness and impartiality, approximating “judicial standards.”

Rule of Law means supremacy of law, equality before law, and that government is subject to law, not above it.

Therefore, administrative action must have legal authority, follow fair procedure, and avoid arbitrariness (Article 14).

Rule of law makes judicial review central: courts ensure legality, relevant considerations, non-mala fides, and reasoned decision.

Administrative law thus becomes the “control mechanism” for modern governance—keeping discretion within legal bounds while enabling welfare functions.

The combined impact is: power + responsibility—administration may act broadly, but only through legal, fair, reviewable processes.

6) Conclusion (3 points)

Administrative law is the legal discipline of controlling public power in a welfare State.

Separation of powers and rule of law together insist on legality + fairness + reviewability.

Thus, administrative law ensures governance is effective yet constitutionally limited.

UNIT 1 — Q2
Classification of Administrative Action and necessity of such classification.

1) Synopsis
Administrative action is classified to apply the correct standard of control (natural justice, ultra vires, reasonableness). Classification is necessary because modern State action is multi-functional and cannot be judged by one uniform test.

2) Introduction

Administrative authorities perform rule-making, executive, and adjudicatory functions.

Classification clarifies procedure, review grounds, and remedies.

It reduces confusion between policy choices and rights-affecting decisions.

3) Laws/Statutes

Constitution: Articles 14, 21 (fairness), 32/226 (writs).

Article 13 (invalidity), plus enabling statutes creating authorities.

4) Answer body

One key classification is legislative / executive / quasi-judicial administrative action.

Legislative (rule-making) action lays down general norms—controlled by delegation limits and ultra vires.

Executive/administrative action implements law—review focuses on arbitrariness, mala fides, irrelevant considerations.

Quasi-judicial action decides rights after hearing—requires natural justice, bias-free process, reasons.

Another classification is ministerial vs discretionary; ministerial is duty-bound, discretionary involves choice but must remain legal and reasonable.

Classification is necessary because natural justice is strongest in quasi-judicial/right-affecting decisions but may be flexible in broad policy.

It helps determine when audi alteram partem applies, and when exceptions (urgency, confidentiality) may be valid.

It identifies the right remedy: certiorari for jurisdictional/procedural error, mandamus for failure of duty, etc.

It also clarifies review of delegated legislation: courts test parent Act policy, consistency, and constitutional limits.

Without classification, courts may either over-interfere in policy or under-protect rights, defeating the object of administrative law.

In welfare administration, classification preserves administrative flexibility while ensuring rights protection.

Hence it is a functional tool to structure judicial control and accountability.

5) Case laws

A.K. Kraipak v Union of India (1969): AIR 1970 SC 150.

Province of Bombay v Khushaldas Advani (1950): AIR 1950 SC 222.

Siemens Engg. v Union of India (1976): AIR 1976 SC 1785; (1976) 2 SCC 981.

Tata Cellular v Union of India (1994): 1996 AIR 11; (1994) 6 SCC 651.

E.P. Royappa v State of Tamil Nadu (1974): 1974 AIR 555; (1974) 4 SCC 3.

6) Conclusion

Classification is the method by which administrative law applies the correct control principles.

It aligns procedure and review with the nature of power exercised.

It thereby prevents both administrative arbitrariness and judicial overreach.

UNIT 1 — Q3
Relationship between Administrative Law and Constitutional Law; Separation of Powers influence.

1) Synopsis
Constitutional law supplies the source, structure, and limits of administrative power; administrative law provides the working controls and remedies. Separation of powers influences administration by enforcing limited functions and judicial review standards.

2) Introduction

Constitution creates the State, organs, and fundamental limits.

Administrative law is the applied side of constitutional governance.

Separation of powers shapes delegation, adjudication, and accountability.

3) Laws/Statutes

Constitution: Articles 14, 19, 21; 32, 226; 13.

Basic Structure: judicial review/rule of law.

Statutes establishing tribunals and authorities (general).

4) Answer body

Administrative law is often called the “constitutional law in action” because it enforces constitutional limitations in day-to-day governance.

Constitutional law defines competence (legislative lists, executive authority) and rights; administrative law prevents abuse of that competence.

Article 14 injects non-arbitrariness into all state action; administrative law operationalises it via doctrines like reasonableness and relevant considerations.

Article 21’s due process/fairness values reflect into administrative procedure through natural justice.

Remedies under Articles 32/226 make administrative law remedy-centric—writs are the backbone of control.

Separation of powers limits legislative delegation: legislature must set policy/standards; otherwise it is excessive delegation.

When executive performs adjudication, separation of powers demands fair hearing, absence of bias, reasons—a judicialised minimum.

Courts respect administrative expertise (policy space) but enforce legality—this balance is a separation-of-powers technique.

Ouster clauses cannot destroy core judicial review because review is tied to rule of law/basic structure.

Administrative authorities must act within jurisdiction, for proper purpose, and without mala fides; these are constitutionalised controls.

Thus, constitutional law supplies “norms,” administrative law supplies “controls.”

The relationship is complementary: constitutional law is the skeleton, administrative law the muscles and nerves ensuring lawful action.

5) Case laws

Kesavananda Bharati (1973): AIR 1973 SC 1461; (1973) 4 SCC 225.

Minerva Mills (1980): AIR 1980 SC 1789; (1980) 3 SCC 625.

L. Chandra Kumar (1997): (1997) 3 SCC 261.

E.P. Royappa (1974): 1974 AIR 555; (1974) 4 SCC 3.

Rai Sahib Ram Jawaya Kapur (1955): AIR 1955 SC 549.

6) Conclusion

Administrative law and constitutional law are inseparable in a modern State.

Separation of powers ensures functional boundaries + controlled delegation + judicialised fairness.

Therefore, administrative law is the practical enforcement of constitutional limitations.
