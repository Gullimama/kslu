Q7. Explain concept & constitutional framework of GST. Discuss salient features of CGST Act, 2017.

1) Synopsis (2 sentences)
GST is a destination-based value-added tax on “supply” of goods or services replacing multi-stage indirect taxes. Its constitutional base is the 101st Constitutional Amendment introducing Art. 246A, 269A, 279A and enabling CGST/SGST/IGST structure.

2) Introduction (3 points)

GST seeks one nation-one tax through harmonised base and credit chain.

It is structured as dual GST: CGST + SGST on intra-State, IGST on inter-State.

The CGST Act is the central law operationalising levy, collection, and ITC.

3) Laws / Statutes (3–4)

Constitution (101st Amendment) Act, 2016: introduces Art. 246A & 279A.

Art. 269A (inter-State GST/IGST settlement principle). (constitutional scheme)

CGST Act, 2017: s.7 (supply), s.9 (levy), s.16 (input tax credit).

Art. 265 (authority of law).

4) Answer body (10–12 points)

GST is a comprehensive indirect tax on supply designed to remove cascading and create seamless credit.

Constitutional shift: Art. 246A creates a special GST field empowering Union and States to legislate on GST.

For inter-State supply, Parliament has exclusive competence (Art. 246A(2)) and levy/settlement under Art. 269A (IGST design).

GST Council (Art. 279A) is a constitutional body ensuring uniformity in rates, exemptions, model laws, and cooperative federalism.

CGST Act’s salient feature: levy on intra-State supply by Centre; SGST by State (dual model).

s.7 CGST defines “supply” broadly covering sale/transfer/barter/lease etc. as per statutory scheme.

s.9 CGST is the charging/levy provision for CGST on taxable supplies.

Tax invoice and documentation establish the audit trail and credit chain (core GST compliance logic).

Input Tax Credit (s.16) enables set-off of input tax against output tax, subject to conditions—key anti-cascading mechanism.

GST is destination based: tax accrues to the jurisdiction of consumption, strengthening neutrality.

It aims to integrate goods and services tax base, addressing classification disputes and enabling common market.

CGST framework is backed by portal-based compliance and matching, improving transparency.

5) Case laws (5 with year & reference) (used as foundational “GST-type” principles from pre-GST indirect tax jurisprudence, commonly discussed in GST texts)

All India Federation of Tax Practitioners v Union of India (2007) — (2007) 7 SCC 527 (service tax as VAT/destination consumption tax concept).

BSNL v Union of India (2006) — (2006) 3 SCC 1 (goods vs services; composite transactions).

Tata Consultancy Services v State of A.P. (2005) — (2005) 1 SCC 308 (software as “goods”).

Larsen & Toubro Ltd v State of Karnataka (2014) — (2014) 1 SCC 708 (works contract; deemed sale; VAT).

R.C. Jall (1962) — AIR 1962 SC 1281 (authority of law principle relevant to tax levy).

6) Conclusion (3 points)

GST rests on Art. 246A/269A/279A and is operationalised through CGST/SGST/IGST laws.

CGST’s core features are supply-based levy + invoice trail + ITC chain.

The constitutional-statutory integration is the hallmark of GST’s “one market” intent.

Q8. Critically analyse Dual GST model. Explain composition/functions of GST Council and role of GSTN.

1) Synopsis (2 sentences)
Dual GST splits levy powers between Centre and States to preserve federalism while ensuring a harmonised base. GST Council is the constitutional mechanism for cooperative decision-making, and GSTN is the technology backbone enabling compliance and tax administration.

2) Introduction (3 points)

Dual GST means concurrent but coordinated taxation on same supply base.

Council ensures uniformity and rate discipline through recommendations.

GSTN ensures standardised digital compliance and system-driven transparency.

3) Laws / Statutes (3–4)

Art. 246A (dual competence for GST).

Art. 279A (GST Council: constitution, composition, functions).

CGST Act, 2017 (operational provisions for levy, invoice, returns).

Art. 265 (authority of law).

4) Answer body (10–12 points)

Dual GST preserves fiscal federalism by allowing both Centre and States to levy GST on intra-State supplies.

It reduces cascading by harmonising base, while enabling State revenue autonomy via SGST component.

Critique: dual levy may increase compliance interfaces, but harmonised law/rate via Council mitigates fragmentation.

Dual model also supports destination principle with settlement mechanisms for inter-State supplies (IGST route).

GST Council (Art. 279A) is constituted by President and includes Union Finance Minister and State Finance Ministers (constitutional design).

Council functions include recommending rates, exemptions, threshold, model laws, special provisions, place-of-supply principles, and dispute resolution methods (as per constitutional intent).

Council embodies cooperative federalism—policy uniformity without destroying State role.

GSTN provides portal infrastructure for registration, return filing, tax payment, refund processing, e-way bill style logistics, and data reconciliation (technology backbone).

GSTN improves traceability by linking invoice-based reporting to credit flow, reducing tax leakage.

GSTN’s systemic design supports analytics-driven enforcement and reduces discretionary interface.

Dual GST’s success depends on rate rationalisation and stable compliance architecture.

In exam, highlight that dual GST is a constitutional compromise: autonomy + common market.

5) Case laws (5 with year & reference)

All India Federation of Tax Practitioners (2007) — (2007) 7 SCC 527 (VAT/destination logic supporting GST philosophy).

BSNL (2006) — (2006) 3 SCC 1 (composite supply logic—relevance to GST disputes).

Tata Consultancy Services (2005) — (2005) 1 SCC 308 (classification foundation).

Larsen & Toubro (2014) — (2014) 1 SCC 708 (works contract; supply character).

R.C. Jall (1962) — AIR 1962 SC 1281 (authority of law).

6) Conclusion (3 points)

Dual GST is the federal design enabling shared taxation with harmonised policy.

GST Council ensures uniformity, and GSTN ensures technology-enabled compliance.

A high-score answer must balance advantages, critiques, and institutional roles.

Q9. Discuss impact of GST on trade/industry/e-commerce/services; benefits to consumers; impact on GDP and inflation.

1) Synopsis (2 sentences)
GST reduces cascading, improves credit flow, and creates a common market, affecting pricing, logistics, and formalisation. Benefits include transparency and neutrality, with macro effects depending on rate structure and compliance efficiency.

2) Introduction (3 points)

GST integrates multiple indirect taxes into a single supply-based framework.

It impacts business through ITC, compliance digitisation, and supply chain restructuring.

Consumer welfare links to tax incidence, reduced cascading, and competitive pricing.

3) Laws / Statutes (3–4)

Art. 246A / 269A / 279A (GST framework & harmonisation).

CGST Act: s.16 ITC (anti-cascading core).

CGST Act: supply/levy architecture (s.7/s.9).

Art. 301–304 (free trade & non-discrimination concept in national market).

4) Answer body (10–12 points)

GST improves trade by reducing tax-on-tax and enabling seamless ITC, lowering embedded costs.

Industry benefits from uniform tax base, reducing classification wars and improving predictability.

Logistics gains occur due to reduced check-post style friction and improved inter-State movement efficiency (common market effect).

E-commerce sees strong compliance integration due to invoice-based reporting and portal-centric systems (greater formalisation).

Service sector benefits from uniformity across States and clearer credit chain for inputs/services (VAT-type destination principle).

Consumers benefit through potential price rationalisation from reduced cascading and increased competition (pass-through).

GST transparency is higher because tax is visible on invoices and credit chain forces documentation discipline.

Negative/transition impacts include initial compliance cost, working capital blocking, and classification disputes in complex supplies.

GDP impact: improved efficiency, formalisation, and investment climate can raise growth; however depends on stability of rates/compliance.

Inflation impact: short-term price adjustments possible; long-term effect depends on anti-cascading and rate neutrality.

GST supports a harmonised national market consistent with constitutional trade freedom principles.

Scoring point: GST’s economic impact is policy-design dependent, not automatic.

5) Case laws (5 with year & reference)

All India Federation of Tax Practitioners (2007) — (2007) 7 SCC 527 (destination VAT logic).

Atiabari Tea (1961) — AIR 1961 SC 232 (common market/trade restrictions lens).

Automobile Transport (1962) — AIR 1962 SC 1406 (trade freedom & reasonable restrictions).

BSNL (2006) — (2006) 3 SCC 1 (classification affecting sectors).

Tata Consultancy Services (2005) — (2005) 1 SCC 308 (digital economy goods principle relevant for e-commerce).

6) Conclusion (3 points)

GST’s primary business effect is credit-driven cost reduction + national market integration.

Consumer and macro outcomes depend on rate rationality and compliance efficiency.

Top answers present sector-wise impact + ITC logic + trade freedom linkage.
