Q10. Explain IGST. Discuss levy on inter-State transactions and imported goods/services.

1) Synopsis (2 sentences)
IGST is the central levy on inter-State supplies to ensure destination-based taxation with seamless credit and settlement between Centre and States. Imports are treated as inter-State supplies for GST purposes to preserve tax neutrality between domestic and imported goods/services.

2) Introduction (3 points)

Inter-State taxation must avoid tax barriers and ensure credit continuity.

IGST model enables one tax on inter-State supply with settlement to consuming State.

Imports are taxed to maintain a level playing field and destination principle.

3) Laws / Statutes (3–4)

Art. 246A(2) (Parliament exclusive power for inter-State GST).

Art. 269A (levy/collection of GST on inter-State supplies; apportionment).

IGST Act, 2017 (conceptual statutory base).

Part XIII (Art. 301–304) (inter-State trade, non-discrimination).

4) Answer body (10–12 points)

IGST is levied by Centre on inter-State supplies to avoid dual collection complexity across borders.

It ensures destination-based consumption tax by settlement mechanism to the destination State.

IGST preserves input tax credit continuity: credit of IGST can generally be used against output tax (system logic).

Place-of-supply principles determine whether supply is inter-State, thereby triggering IGST.

Import of goods/services is treated as inter-State supply to ensure imported supplies bear GST and do not gain tax advantage.

This integrates customs+GST incidence so that import entry does not break the credit chain (policy design).

Art. 246A(2) constitutionally secures Parliamentary competence for inter-State levy.

IGST model supports national market by preventing State-wise tax barriers.

Settlement/apportionment under constitutional scheme avoids fiscal disputes and ensures consuming State revenue.

Inter-State supply taxation must still align with constitutional trade freedom ethos and non-discrimination.

IGST simplifies compliance by treating inter-State supplies under a single central levy with settlement.

For exam, emphasise: trigger = inter-State supply; collector = Centre; beneficiary = destination State.

5) Case laws (5 with year & reference)

Atiabari Tea (1961) — AIR 1961 SC 232 (inter-State trade and tax barriers).

Automobile Transport (1962) — AIR 1962 SC 1406 (trade freedom limits).

Jindal Stainless (2016) — (2016) 11 SCC 1 (non-discriminatory taxes & Part XIII).

All India Federation of Tax Practitioners (2007) — (2007) 7 SCC 527 (destination VAT concept).

R.C. Jall (1962) — AIR 1962 SC 1281 (authority of law).

6) Conclusion (3 points)

IGST is the constitutional-statutory solution for inter-State GST with destination settlement.

Imports are aligned to GST’s destination principle to ensure neutrality.

High-score answers link Art. 246A(2)/269A + Part XIII + credit continuity.

Q11. Critically examine SGST law; power of Centre to levy tax on inter-State taxable supply; impact on State revenue; indemnifying loss.

1) Synopsis (2 sentences)
SGST is the State component of GST on intra-State supplies, forming the fiscal backbone for States under the dual model. Centre’s power on inter-State supply (IGST) and compensation/indemnification mechanisms address State revenue concerns during transition.

2) Introduction (3 points)

SGST preserves State fiscal autonomy within a harmonised GST base.

Inter-State supply is constitutionally centralised to avoid trade barriers.

Revenue impact is managed through constitutional design and compensation law concept.

3) Laws / Statutes (3–4)

Art. 246A (State power to levy GST on intra-State supplies; shared field).

Art. 269A (Centre levy for inter-State supply; settlement).

Art. 279A (GST Council recommendations for rates/compensation policy).

Part XIII (Art. 301–304) (State taxes must avoid discrimination in trade).

4) Answer body (10–12 points)

SGST is levied by States on intra-State supplies, ensuring States have an assured GST revenue stream.

Dual levy means the same taxable event (intra-State supply) attracts CGST + SGST, but credit chain avoids cascading.

Critique: SGST requires high coordination to prevent rate/base fragmentation; this is mitigated by Council-driven harmonisation.

Centre’s inter-State levy power is anchored in Art. 246A(2) and Art. 269A, preventing multiple State levies on the same inter-State transaction.

State revenue concerns arise from subsuming earlier taxes and moving to destination principle where consuming State benefits.

Compensation/indemnification concept protects States from revenue shortfall during transition (policy mechanism recognised in GST framework).

Council plays a key role in recommending compensation period, rates and structure (cooperative design).

SGST laws are aligned to model law format to reduce compliance differences.

States’ ability to raise revenue remains, but is balanced against national market objective.

Part XIII principles ensure State taxation does not create discriminatory barriers to inter-State trade.

GST thus constitutionalises cooperative fiscal federalism, not competitive tax fragmentation.

Strong answers show: SGST autonomy + IGST centrality + compensation rationale + Council harmonisation.

5) Case laws (5 with year & reference)

Jindal Stainless (2016) — (2016) 11 SCC 1 (non-discrimination; trade freedom).

Atiabari Tea (1961) — AIR 1961 SC 232 (trade barriers).

Automobile Transport (1962) — AIR 1962 SC 1406 (reasonable restrictions).

Kesoram Industries (2004) — (2004) 10 SCC 201 (nature of levy & competence).

State of W.B. v Union of India (1963) — AIR 1963 SC 1241 (federal balance).

6) Conclusion (3 points)

SGST ensures State revenue presence within dual GST, while IGST centralises inter-State levy to protect national market.

Council-based harmonisation and compensation design manage State revenue concerns.

Exam answers must integrate constitutional allocation + trade freedom + fiscal federalism.

Q12. Explain UTGST. Discuss GST exemption on securities and Securities Transaction Tax (STT).

1) Synopsis (2 sentences)
UTGST applies GST framework to Union Territories without legislature (or as applicable), ensuring uniform GST reach. Securities are typically outside GST supply base, and STT is a separate levy on securities transactions.

2) Introduction (3 points)

UTGST extends GST architecture to Union Territories for completeness of tax base.

Exclusion/exemption of securities avoids overlap with financial market levies.

STT functions as a transaction-based tax on securities trades.

3) Laws / Statutes (3–4)

Art. 246A (GST legislative field across India).

UTGST Act, 2017 (Union Territory GST framework).

CGST Act, 2017 (definitions/levy structure that UTGST mirrors).

STT provisions (Income-tax framework conceptually—STT is a separate transaction levy).

4) Answer body (10–12 points)

UTGST is designed to levy GST in Union Territories, paralleling SGST where State law would otherwise apply.

It ensures that intra-UT supplies bear CGST + UTGST, maintaining dual model consistency.

UTGST prevents fiscal vacuum by providing a local-component GST in UT areas.

The UTGST law is structurally aligned with CGST/SGST model provisions to preserve uniform compliance.

Securities are treated distinctly because they represent financial instruments, and GST framework typically keeps them outside supply tax base to avoid cascading in capital markets.

Exemption/exclusion helps prevent overlap with securities market regulations and transaction taxes.

STT is levied on securities transactions and operates as a separate fiscal instrument.

The rationale is administrative convenience, market transparency, and revenue collection from organised exchanges.

GST exclusion of securities and STT levy together reflect a policy choice: keep capital market trades outside GST chain.

UTGST ensures uniformity of GST coverage across India’s territories and maintains credit chain consistency.

Exam point: UTGST is territorial application of GST, not a new taxable event.

A complete answer must show UTGST purpose + securities treatment + STT as separate transaction levy.

5) Case laws (5 with year & reference) (general classification/transaction-tax principles relevant to indirect tax treatment)

R.C. Jall (1962) — AIR 1962 SC 1281 (authority of law for any tax).

Kesoram Industries (2004) — (2004) 10 SCC 201 (nature/character of impost).

All India Federation of Tax Practitioners (2007) — (2007) 7 SCC 527 (indirect tax character).

BSNL (2006) — (2006) 3 SCC 1 (classification boundaries).

Tata Consultancy Services (2005) — (2005) 1 SCC 308 (what constitutes “goods” in tax law).

6) Conclusion (3 points)

UTGST ensures GST applies uniformly in Union Territories through CGST + UTGST design.

Securities are kept outside GST to avoid tax cascade in financial markets; STT separately taxes securities trades.

High scoring requires stating purpose, structure, and policy rationale clearly.
