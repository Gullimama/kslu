# Unit 5 — Liability; wrongful act; substantive & procedural law

## Question 1
Explain the maxims “Damnum Sine Injuria” and “Injuria Sine Damnum” with case laws. When is an act considered a legal injury?

### Synopsis
Damnum sine injuria means damage without legal injury; injuria sine damnum means legal injury without actual damage. Legal injury occurs when a recognized right is violated, even without measurable loss. Liability depends on breach of a legal right, not merely on loss.

### Introduction
The question concerns the distinction between factual loss and legal injury. The texts approach wrongful acts through the lens of rights and liabilities, emphasizing that law protects rights rather than mere interests.

### Statutes (laws verbatim)
- “A right in rem … corresponds to a duty imposed upon persons in general; a right in personam … corresponds to a duty imposed upon determinate individuals.”
- “Liability for hurtful acts of commission is the general rule, [liability] for acts of omission is the exception.”

### Body (detailed answer explanation)
1. **Damnum sine injuria:** Loss without violation of a legal right.
2. **No remedy:** Law does not compensate every loss if the act is lawful.
3. **Injuria sine damnum:** Violation of a legal right without actual loss.
4. **Actionable per se:** Proof of damage is not necessary once right is infringed.
5. **Legal injury:** Exists when a recognized right is breached.
6. **Right‑based approach:** Law protects rights rather than mere interests.
7. **Duty correlation:** Legal injury depends on breach of a correlative duty.
8. **Omission rule:** Liability for omissions is exceptional and requires a duty.
9. **Policy rationale:** Prevents excessive litigation for purely economic loss.
10. **Remedy focus:** Civil law provides redress only when a right is violated.
11. **Example contrast:** Competitive loss without right violation is non‑actionable.
12. **Key test:** Identify the right and show its infringement.

### Case laws (5)
- **Bradford Corporation v. Pickles (1895)** — loss without legal injury.
- **Bromage v. Prosser (1825)** — injury to reputation as legal injury.
- **Moses v. Macferlan (1760)** — legal injury and restitution.
- **Donoghue v. Stevenson (1932)** — breach of duty as legal injury.
- **Gorris v. Scott (1874)** — damage without breach of legal duty.

### Conclusion
The law protects rights, not merely interests. Legal injury depends on violation of a recognized right, while mere loss without such violation is not actionable.

## Question 2
Define liability and explain the essential conditions for imposing civil and criminal liability. Discuss the concepts of mens rea, intention, malice, and negligence.

### Synopsis
Liability is legal responsibility for a wrong. Its conditions generally include wrongful act or omission, causation, and fault (intention or negligence), though strict liability is an exception. Mens rea is the guilty mind; negligence is failure to meet the objective standard of care.

### Introduction
The texts analyze liability as a central legal concept, distinguishing civil and criminal responsibility and explaining the role of fault.

### Statutes (laws verbatim)
- “The standard of care represents the degree of care which should be used in the circumstances.”
- “Strict liability … [is] responsibility irrespective of the existence of either wrongful intent or negligence.”

### Body (detailed answer explanation)
1. **Meaning:** Liability is legal responsibility for a wrong.
2. **Civil liability:** Aims at compensation and redress.
3. **Criminal liability:** Aims at punishment for public wrongs.
4. **Wrongful act/omission:** Breach of a legal duty is essential.
5. **Causation:** Act must cause the harm or injury.
6. **Fault principle:** Intention or negligence usually required.
7. **Mens rea:** Guilty mind required for most crimes.
8. **Intention:** Deliberate aim to cause a result.
9. **Malice:** Wrongful intent or ill‑will; intensifies culpability.
10. **Negligence:** Failure to meet reasonable person standard.
11. **Objective test:** Negligence judged by external standard, not personal state.
12. **Strict liability:** Exception where fault is not required.

### Case laws (5)
- **R. v. Prince (1875)** — mens rea and criminal liability.
- **R. v. Tolson (1889)** — mistake and culpability.
- **Bratty v. Att.-Gen. (1963)** — mental element in criminal law.
- **Derry v. Peek (1889)** — fraud and intention.
- **Donoghue v. Stevenson (1932)** — negligence and standard of care.

### Conclusion
Liability depends on breach of duty with fault, except in strict liability cases. Mens rea, intention, malice, and negligence determine the quality and degree of fault in civil and criminal responsibility.

## Question 3
Distinguish between strict liability and vicarious liability with leading case laws. Also distinguish between substantive law and procedural law.

### Synopsis
Strict liability imposes responsibility without fault in specific cases. Vicarious liability imposes responsibility on one person for the acts of another (e.g., employer‑employee). Substantive law defines rights and duties; procedural law provides the machinery for their enforcement.

### Introduction
The texts treat strict and vicarious liability as important exceptions to fault‑based responsibility, and also distinguish substantive from procedural law.

### Statutes (laws verbatim)
- “Strict liability … [is] responsibility irrespective of the existence of either wrongful intent or negligence.”
- “Modern civil law recognises vicarious liability in two chief classes of cases … masters … and representatives of dead men.”

### Body (detailed answer explanation)
1. **Strict liability:** Liability without proof of intention or negligence.
2. **Fault exception:** It is an exception to the general fault requirement.
3. **Civil focus:** Often used in civil law where proof of fault is difficult.
4. **Criminal caution:** The texts note objections to strict liability in criminal law.
5. **Policy basis:** Simplifies proof and protects social interests.
6. **Vicarious liability:** One person answers for another’s wrongful act.
7. **Employer liability:** Master liable for servant’s acts in course of employment.
8. **Evidential reason:** Authority and complicity are hard to prove directly.
9. **Risk allocation:** Employer better able to bear loss and insure.
10. **Substantive law:** Defines rights, duties, and liabilities.
11. **Procedural law:** Provides the method of enforcing rights in court.
12. **Functional difference:** Substantive says what; procedural says how.

### Case laws (5)
- **Rylands v. Fletcher (1868)** — classic strict liability.
- **Donoghue v. Stevenson (1932)** — fault‑based negligence contrasted with strict liability.
- **Pickard v. Smith (1861)** — vicarious responsibility themes.
- **Wilson v. Brett (1843)** — master–servant liability.
- **Chisholm v. Doulton (1889)** — liability without fault and its limits.

### Conclusion
Strict liability dispenses with fault; vicarious liability shifts responsibility to another person. Substantive law defines rights and liabilities, while procedural law provides the mechanism for enforcement.
