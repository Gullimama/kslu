Q1. Distinguish between Direct and Indirect taxes. Explain tax evasion, tax planning and tax avoidance with examples.

1) Synopsis (2 sentences)
Direct tax is imposed on a person in respect of income/wealth and is borne by the same person, while indirect tax is imposed on transactions/consumption and is generally passed on. Tax evasion is illegal concealment, tax avoidance is colourable but technically legal arrangement, and tax planning is legitimate structuring within law.

2) Introduction (3 points)

Tax is a compulsory exaction by the State for public purposes, enforceable by law.

Incidence and shifting are the core tests to differentiate direct and indirect taxes.

Modern taxation policy aims at equity (direct tax) and efficiency/consumption neutrality (indirect tax).

3) Laws / Statutes (3–4)

Constitution of India: Art. 265 (no tax except by authority of law).

Seventh Schedule: Union/State taxing entries (Lists I & II) (distribution basis).

Income-tax Act, 1961: charging structure via total income (conceptual basis).

CGST Act, 2017: levy on “supply” (conceptual indirect tax base).

4) Answer body (10–12 points)

Direct tax: imposed directly on the assessee (e.g., income-tax), and burden is intended to be borne by the same person.

Indirect tax: imposed on transactions/consumption (e.g., GST/customs), and tax burden is ordinarily shifted to the consumer through price.

Test of incidence: direct tax attaches to person/ability to pay; indirect tax attaches to event of supply/import/consumption.

Collection mechanism: direct tax uses assessment/returns/TDS, whereas indirect tax uses invoice chain, input tax credit, point-of-tax rules.

Equity rationale: direct taxes are linked to progressivity and redistribution; indirect taxes are largely regressive unless rate-designed.

Compliance visibility: direct tax requires disclosure of income; indirect tax is embedded in business documentation (invoices, returns).

Tax evasion: illegal suppression/misrepresentation—e.g., non-reporting salary interest, fake bills, clandestine removal, undervaluation, unaccounted sales.

Evasion violates Art. 265’s authority of law and statutory obligations; invites penalties/prosecution under taxing statutes.

Tax planning: legitimate arrangement of affairs within law—e.g., using eligible deductions, choosing permissible business structure, proper classification under statute.

Tax avoidance: arranging affairs to reduce tax via artificial devices without real commercial substance (often “colourable”).

Planning is permitted because taxpayer may choose lawful alternatives; avoidance is discouraged when it defeats legislative intent.

A clear exam distinction: planning = within object of law, avoidance = against object though within form, evasion = against law.

5) Case laws (5 with year & reference)

R.C. Jall v Union of India (1962) — AIR 1962 SC 1281 (Art. 265; tax only by authority of law).

Hingir-Rampur Coal Co. v State of Orissa (1961) — AIR 1961 SC 459 (tax/fee/cess characterisation principles).

State of W.B. v Kesoram Industries Ltd (2004) — (2004) 10 SCC 201 (nature of cess/tax; entries; character test).

Atiabari Tea Co. v State of Assam (1961) — AIR 1961 SC 232 (Part XIII; trade & taxation).

Automobile Transport (Rajasthan) Ltd v State of Rajasthan (1962) — AIR 1962 SC 1406 (regulatory/compensatory taxes; Art. 301–304).

6) Conclusion (3 points)

Direct taxes focus on person-based incidence, while indirect taxes focus on transaction/consumption-based incidence and shifting.

Evasion is criminal/illegal, avoidance is technically legal but anti-intent, and planning is lawful optimisation.

A scoring answer must show the incidence test + legality test + examples anchored in Art. 265.

Q2. Discuss the Federal Base of Taxing Power under the Constitution. Explain distribution of taxing powers between Centre and States.

1) Synopsis (2 sentences)
India’s taxing power is federal and list-based, where legislative competence flows from Articles 246/246A and the Seventh Schedule. The Constitution allocates taxes through Union, State, and concurrent mechanisms plus sharing/assignment provisions.

2) Introduction (3 points)

Federalism in taxation balances unity of market and State fiscal autonomy.

Distribution is primarily via Seventh Schedule entries, supplemented by distribution/assignment articles.

GST introduces a special concurrent taxing field through Art. 246A.

3) Laws / Statutes (3–4)

Art. 246 + Seventh Schedule (Lists I & II) — legislative competence.

Art. 265 — authority of law requirement.

Art. 268–271 — levy/collection/distribution of certain duties; surcharge.

Art. 246A & 269A + Art. 279A (GST allocation & Council).

4) Answer body (10–12 points)

The federal base means taxing powers are constitutionally enumerated, not inherent.

Union List confers exclusive Parliament power over specified taxes (e.g., customs, corporation tax, certain excises—conceptually).

State List reserves taxes on subjects of local/state domain (e.g., taxes on lands/buildings, certain local levies—conceptually).

No tax without competence: if legislature lacks entry, tax fails for lack of legislative authority.

Art. 265 ensures tax can be imposed/collected only under valid law.

Inter-governmental fiscal relations are strengthened by sharing/assignment (Art. 268–270 type mechanisms).

Surcharge power allows Union to impose surcharge on certain Union taxes (constitutional design for national needs).

Restrictions on State taxation in inter-State context: Constitution regulates extra-territorial reach and trade barriers.

GST created a structural shift: Art. 246A gives both Parliament and States power to make GST laws.

For inter-State supply, Parliament has exclusive competence under Art. 246A(2) and levy/settlement under Art. 269A (IGST principle).

GST Council (Art. 279A) institutionalises cooperative federalism via rate/base harmonisation.

Thus, distribution works through (i) Lists, (ii) GST special field, (iii) distribution articles, (iv) constitutional limitations.

5) Case laws (5 with year & reference)

State of W.B. v Union of India (1963) — AIR 1963 SC 1241 (federal structure; inter-governmental relations).

R.C. Jall v Union of India (1962) — AIR 1962 SC 1281 (Art. 265).

Kesoram Industries (2004) — (2004) 10 SCC 201 (entry/character of impost).

Atiabari Tea Co. (1961) — AIR 1961 SC 232 (trade freedom and taxes).

Automobile Transport (1962) — AIR 1962 SC 1406 (reasonable restrictions/compensatory).

6) Conclusion (3 points)

Taxing power is allocated, enumerated, and limited—not general.

GST reshaped fiscal federalism through Art. 246A/269A/279A.

A complete exam answer must mention Lists + distribution articles + Part XIII limits + GST Council.

Q3. Examine the scope of taxing powers of Parliament. Discuss immunity of State agencies/instrumentalities from taxation.

1) Synopsis (2 sentences)
Parliament’s taxing power is wide within Union competence and constitutionally strengthened for inter-State and national taxes, subject to constitutional limitations. State property/income enjoys limited immunity from Union taxation, but immunity is qualified and not absolute.

2) Introduction (3 points)

Parliamentary power is defined by constitutional entries and inter-State competence.

Immunity provisions protect federal balance but allow taxation of State trading/business activities.

The exam focus is the scope + exceptions + judicial approach.

3) Laws / Statutes (3–4)

Art. 245–246 + Seventh Schedule (Union legislative power).

Art. 265 (authority of law).

Art. 289 (State property/income immunity; qualified exceptions).

Part XIII (Art. 301–304) (commerce clause constraints).

4) Answer body (10–12 points)

Parliament can levy taxes falling in the Union List and in special constitutional fields (e.g., inter-State GST via Art. 246A(2)).

The scope includes creating charging provisions, machinery provisions, assessment, collection, recovery, offences, and adjudicatory forums.

Parliament’s fiscal laws typically contain anti-evasion, penalty, interest, and prosecution provisions as integral machinery.

Parliamentary power is subject to constitutional limitations: (i) competence, (ii) fundamental rights constraints in taxation, (iii) Part XIII trade freedom limits.

Immunity doctrine: State property/income is protected against Union tax under Art. 289(1), but not where the State carries on trade/business (Art. 289(2) concept).

Thus, if State instrumentalities undertake commercial activities, immunity narrows to prevent unfair advantage.

Local bodies/authorities may tax within delegated fields, but delegation must remain within constitutional limits.

Courts apply the pith and substance test: true nature of levy determines competence.

Immunity is not a blanket shield against every fiscal imposition—it is textually bounded.

For inter-State commerce related taxes, Parliament’s design must respect non-discrimination and constitutional trade balance.

Judicial trend: preserve federal balance while preventing tax barriers that fragment the national market.

Therefore, Parliament’s power is expansive but constitutionally structured, limited, and reviewable.

5) Case laws (5 with year & reference)

New Delhi Municipal Committee v State of Punjab (1997) — (1997) 7 SCC 339 (State immunity & taxation on State property; Art. 289 context).

State of W.B. v Union of India (1963) — AIR 1963 SC 1241 (federal balance).

R.C. Jall (1962) — AIR 1962 SC 1281 (authority of law).

Atiabari Tea (1961) — AIR 1961 SC 232 (trade freedom & tax barriers).

Jindal Stainless Ltd v State of Haryana (2016) — (2016) 11 SCC 1 (Part XIII; non-discriminatory taxes; inter-State trade).

6) Conclusion (3 points)

Parliament’s taxing power is broad but entry-controlled and limited by Part XIII + competence + Art. 265.

State immunity is qualified, especially where State engages in trade/business.

Strong answers show scope + machinery + exceptions + leading constitutional cases.
