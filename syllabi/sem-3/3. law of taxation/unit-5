Q13. Legislative background and nature of Customs law; levy, exemption and collection of customs duties.

1) Synopsis (2 sentences)
Customs law regulates import/export, protects revenue, and controls cross-border trade through duties, restrictions, and procedures. The Customs Act, 1962 provides the framework for levy, valuation, exemptions, and collection.

2) Introduction (3 points)

Customs duty is a tax on import/export governed by statute and tariff.

The Customs Act provides substantive levy + procedural machinery at ports/airports/ICDs.

Exemptions and valuation are central to duty computation and administration.

3) Laws / Statutes (3–4)

Customs Act, 1962: s.12 (levy of customs duty).

s.14 (valuation of imported goods).

s.25 (power to grant exemption by notification).

Customs Tariff Act, 1975 (rate schedule conceptually, read with Customs Act).

4) Answer body (10–12 points)

Customs law arises from sovereign power to regulate cross-border trade and raise revenue through duties.

s.12 is the charging provision: duty is levied on goods imported into or exported from India, as per the Tariff.

Levy is supported by machinery for assessment, self-assessment, reassessment, and collection at the customs station.

Duty computation depends on classification, valuation, and rate.

Valuation (s.14) determines assessable value as per statutory rules, ensuring uniformity and preventing undervaluation.

Exemption (s.25) enables Government to exempt absolutely or conditionally in public interest, forming fiscal policy tool.

Customs administration operates through notified customs ports/airports/warehouses, enabling control and deferred clearance.

Import/export controls include prohibitions/restrictions under allied laws, enforced through customs checks.

Collection is at the point where goods cross customs barrier and are cleared for home consumption/export.

Procedural compliance (filing documents, payment, examination) is integral to lawful import/export.

Non-compliance triggers confiscation/penalties/adjudication under the Act’s enforcement scheme.

A complete answer shows s.12 levy + s.14 valuation + s.25 exemption + port procedure.

Q14. Clearance from port incl. baggage; goods by post; stores; goods in transit.

1) Synopsis (2 sentences)
Customs clearance is a controlled process ensuring lawful import/export through declarations, assessment, payment, and out-of-charge. Special procedures apply for baggage, postal imports/exports, stores on vessels/aircraft, and goods in transit.

Stores: goods for consumption on vessels/aircraft are regulated to prevent diversion into domestic market without duty.

Goods in transit/transhipment are allowed movement under customs control to prevent duty evasion.

Warehousing facilitates deferred duty payment with controlled storage and later clearance.

Customs procedure aims at balancing trade facilitation and revenue/security.

Non-declaration/misdeclaration may lead to confiscation, penalty, and prosecution as per Act.

Q15. Duty drawback; authorities/powers/functions; role of SEZ units.

1) Synopsis (2 sentences)
Duty drawback refunds specified duties on exported goods to neutralise domestic tax incidence and enhance export competitiveness. Customs authorities administer assessment, enforcement and refund mechanisms, while SEZ units operate as export-oriented enclaves with specified customs/GST benefits under special regime.

2) Introduction (3 points)

Drawback is an export incentive/neutralisation tool, not a general exemption.

Administration depends on statutory authorities exercising powers of assessment, search, confiscation, adjudication and appeal.

SEZ framework supports exports through procedural facilitation and fiscal benefits.

3) Laws / Statutes (3–4)

Customs Act, 1962: Drawback provisions (ss.74/75) (re-export/manufacture drawback scheme).

Customs Act: authority appointment & powers (s.4 and enforcement scheme concept).

SEZ Act, 2005 (SEZ unit fiscal/procedural framework).

Art. 265 (refund/levy legality in tax system).

4) Answer body (10–12 points)

Duty drawback aims to make exports tax-neutral by rebating duties embedded in inputs/materials used in export goods.

s.74 generally concerns drawback on re-export of imported goods (subject to conditions).

s.75 generally concerns drawback on exported goods manufactured/processed using imported materials (statutory scheme).

Drawback requires compliance with export documentation, identity of goods, time limits, and prescribed conditions.

Customs authorities verify export, examine claims, and prevent fraudulent drawback by audit and investigation.

Authorities include proper officers empowered for assessment, examination, seizure, confiscation, adjudication, and penalty imposition under Act.

Appeals lie through statutory appellate channels, ensuring legality and procedural fairness.

Refund principles (including unjust enrichment logic in indirect taxes) influence how refunds/drawbacks are processed.

SEZ units operate within a special legal regime aimed at promoting exports, with customs-style control at SEZ boundary.

Goods/services supplied to SEZ may receive fiscal benefits as per special law and GST framework (policy neutrality).

SEZ procedures simplify movement and reduce transaction costs while maintaining customs supervision.

Strong answer: define drawback, cite sections, list authority functions, connect SEZ export rationale.
