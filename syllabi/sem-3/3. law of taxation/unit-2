Q4. Define ‘Income’. Explain basis of taxation with reference to residential status and incidence of tax.

1) Synopsis (2 sentences)
“Income” is an inclusive statutory concept and the charge depends on scope of total income and residential status. Residential status determines whether income is taxed on receipt/accrual/arising in India and the incidence differs for residents and non-residents.

2) Introduction (3 points)

Income-tax is a direct tax on total income of a “person”.

The charging scheme relies on definition + scope provisions + residence rules.

Exam scoring depends on linking s.2(24) + s.5 + s.6 clearly.

3) Laws / Statutes (3–4)

Income-tax Act, 1961: s.2(24) (inclusive definition of income).

s.4 (charging section) + s.5 (scope of total income).

s.6 (residential status).

Constitution Art. 265 (authority of law).

4) Answer body (10–12 points)

“Income” under s.2(24) is inclusive—it expands beyond ordinary meaning to cover receipts deemed as income.

The basis of taxation is total income of the assessee for the previous year, charged through s.4.

s.5 sets the scope: taxable income covers income received, deemed received, accruing/arising, or deemed to accrue/arise according to status.

Residential status is determined under s.6 and is foundational to incidence of tax.

Resident and ordinarily resident (ROR) is taxed on global income, subject to the Act.

Resident but not ordinarily resident (RNOR) has restricted global taxation (typically foreign income taxed only if derived from Indian business/profession or received in India).

Non-resident (NR) is taxable mainly on income received in India or accruing/arising/deemed in India.

Thus, incidence of tax means “who is taxed and on what territorial basis”—and depends on residence and source/receipt rules.

“Person” as taxable unit includes individuals, HUF, firm, company, AOP/BOI, local authority etc. (core conceptual definition used in Act).

Classification of receipts into heads (salary/house property/business/capital gains/other sources) is computation machinery and does not dilute charge.

Deeming fictions ensure anti-avoidance in cross-border contexts by treating certain income as accruing in India.

A complete answer ties: Income (s.2(24)) → Charge (s.4) → Scope (s.5) → Residence (s.6).

5) Case laws (5 with year & reference)

CIT v B.C. Srinivasa Setty (1981) — (1981) 128 ITR 294 (SC) (capital gains computation & charging-machinery linkage principle).

G. Venkataswami Naidu & Co v CIT (1959) — 35 ITR 594 (SC) (real nature/characterisation of receipt/transaction).

East India Housing & Land Development Trust v CIT (1961) — 42 ITR 49 (SC) (classification under heads; income character).

CIT v L.W. Russel (1964) — 53 ITR 91 (SC) (salary/perquisite principles).

Dhakeswari Cotton Mills v CIT (1954) — 26 ITR 775 (SC) (assessment fairness; evidence/natural justice).

6) Conclusion (3 points)

“Income” is inclusive, and charge is on total income through the Act’s structured scheme.

Residential status (s.6) determines territorial incidence under s.5.

High-scoring answers explicitly connect s.2(24) + s.4 + s.5 + s.6.

Q5. Discuss computation of income from salaries, house property, business/profession, and capital gains.

1) Synopsis (2 sentences)
Income computation is head-wise and follows specific statutory rules for each head. Salary, house property, business/profession, and capital gains are computed under distinct provisions with defined inclusions, deductions, and deeming rules.

2) Introduction (3 points)

The Act adopts head-wise classification to compute taxable total income.

Each head has (i) charging/computation section, (ii) deductions, (iii) special deeming rules.

Clear section-mapping is the key to full marks.

3) Laws / Statutes (3–4)

Salary: ss.15–17 (salary basis/perquisites/profits in lieu).

House Property: ss.22–27 (annual value; deductions).

Business/Profession: ss.28–44 (profits & gains; allowances; method).

Capital Gains: ss.45–55 (transfer; computation; cost).

4) Answer body (10–12 points)

Salary (ss.15–17): charge arises on salary due/paid, including advance salary, and includes perquisites and profits in lieu as defined.

Standard salary computation steps: identify gross salary → exempt allowances → deductions (if applicable) → taxable salary (statutory method).

House Property (ss.22–27): tax is on annual value of property of which assessee is owner, excluding property used for own business/profession.

Compute annual value via expected rent/actual rent framework; then allow statutory deductions (notably the standard deduction on NAV and interest on borrowed capital, subject to conditions).

Business/Profession (ss.28–44): taxable profits are computed on commercial principles as modified by the Act, allowing specified deductions and disallowing prohibited expenses.

Correct head selection matters: receipts must be tested whether they are business income or fall under other heads, based on real nature.

Depreciation is a statutory allowance; method of accounting and computation is governed by the Act (core structure).

Capital Gains (ss.45–55): charge on profits arising from transfer of a capital asset, subject to computation mechanism (full value of consideration minus cost/expenses).

Classification into short-term/long-term affects computation and rate outcomes (conceptual).

Certain assets have special cost/indexation/deeming rules; computation is strictly statutory.

Heads are mutually exclusive in principle; if a receipt is properly classifiable under a specific head, it should be computed there.

Total income equals aggregate of head-wise incomes after permissible set-offs and deductions.

5) Case laws (5 with year & reference)

CIT v L.W. Russel (1964) — 53 ITR 91 (SC) (salary/perquisite).

East India Housing v CIT (1961) — 42 ITR 49 (SC) (house property vs business head).

G. Venkataswami Naidu & Co v CIT (1959) — 35 ITR 594 (SC) (business vs investment; nature of transaction).

CIT v B.C. Srinivasa Setty (1981) — 128 ITR 294 (SC) (capital gains computation principle).

Dhakeswari Cotton Mills v CIT (1954) — 26 ITR 775 (SC) (best judgment/assessment fairness).

6) Conclusion (3 points)

Computation is section-driven and head-wise, not discretionary.

High marks come from writing section mapping + steps + key inclusions/deductions.

Case law supports proper classification and computation integrity.

Q6. Explain assessment provisions; powers/functions of IT authorities; filing of returns; appeal & revision.

1) Synopsis (2 sentences)
Assessment is the statutory process of determining taxable income and tax liability through self-assessment and departmental assessment mechanisms. The Act creates a structured administrative hierarchy for returns, scrutiny, reassessment, collection, appeals, revision, and penalties.

2) Introduction (3 points)

Assessment combines charging + computation + procedure + enforcement.

Returns and e-filing form the base for self-assessment and scrutiny.

Appeal/revision ensures correctness and legality of tax administration.

3) Laws / Statutes (3–4)

s.139 (return of income; filing).

s.143 (scrutiny assessment) + s.144 (best judgment).

s.147 (income escaping assessment; reassessment).

s.246A (appealable orders) + appellate procedure provisions (CIT(A)/ITAT scheme).

4) Answer body (10–12 points)

Filing of return under s.139 triggers the assessment machinery; e-filing operationalises compliance through portal-based submission.

Assessment begins with self-assessment, supported by statutory verification and computation (conceptual).

s.143 empowers scrutiny to determine correct income, allowing adjustments and lawful determination after due process.

s.144 enables best judgment assessment where return/non-compliance justifies it, but it must be fair and reasoned.

s.147 reassessment applies where income has escaped assessment, subject to procedural safeguards and recorded reasons.

Income-tax authorities are statutorily appointed, forming hierarchy with defined jurisdiction and functions (assessment, investigation, penalty, recovery).

Collection and recovery provisions allow demand, interest, and lawful recovery methods (conceptual).

Appeals: certain orders are appealable under s.246A, enabling merits review by first appellate authority.

Further appeal lies to Tribunal and higher courts on substantial questions of law (system design).

Revision powers exist to correct erroneous orders or to protect revenue, within statutory limits and natural justice.

Offences/penalties provisions enforce compliance; mens rea/strict liability varies by provision but statutory scheme is deterrent.

A complete answer must show the return → assessment types → authorities → appeal/revision → recovery/penalty chain.

5) Case laws (5 with year & reference)

GKN Driveshafts (India) Ltd v ITO (2003) — (2003) 259 ITR 19 (SC) (reassessment procedure; objections).

Dhakeswari Cotton Mills v CIT (1954) — 26 ITR 775 (SC) (natural justice in assessment).

R.C. Jall (1962) — AIR 1962 SC 1281 (authority of law; levy/collection legality).

East India Housing v CIT (1961) — 42 ITR 49 (SC) (correct head/assessment correctness).

CIT v L.W. Russel (1964) — 53 ITR 91 (SC) (statutory interpretation of salary provisions in assessment).

6) Conclusion (3 points)

Assessment is a statutory, staged determination driven by returns and procedural safeguards.

Authorities’ powers are defined and reviewable, with appeals/revision ensuring legality.

Scoring answers present the entire lifecycle: return → scrutiny/best judgment/reassessment → recovery → appeal/revision → penalties.
