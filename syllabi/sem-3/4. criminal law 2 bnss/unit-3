7) Distinguish Sessions trial vs warrant/summons trials + significance of summary trials

1. Synopsis
Trial forms differ by forum, seriousness, and procedure, ensuring proportional safeguards. Summary trials are a deliberate speed mechanism for minor offences with restricted sentencing.

2. Introduction

Sessions trial handles gravest offences with enhanced safeguards.

Warrant and summons trials reflect seriousness gradation at Magistrate level.

Summary trials reduce backlog while maintaining core fairness.

3. Laws/Statutes

BNSS Ch. XXII Summary trials: ss.283–288.

BNSS evidence recording framework (Ch. XXV—scheme around s.307 onwards).

Constitution: Art. 21 fair trial; Art. 14 equal procedure.

4. Answer body

Sessions trial is conducted by Court of Session and is designed for serious offences—committal gatekeeping and structured stages.

Magistrate trials are divided into warrant and summons cases, reflecting higher vs lower gravity.

Warrant cases generally involve more elaborate steps (charge formalities, stronger procedural structure).

Summons cases are simpler, with streamlined recording to avoid delay for less serious offences.

Summary trial is the most accelerated form—used for specified minor offences and limited punishment.

BNSS empowers summary trial with an outer cap: no imprisonment exceeding three months in summary conviction.

Summary trial record is concise but mandatory particulars (accused details, offence, plea, finding, sentence) are required.

If case complexity appears during summary trial, Magistrate must convert to regular procedure by recalling witnesses and re-hearing.

Significance: summary trials protect system efficiency, enabling courts to devote time to serious matters.

Safeguard: speed cannot defeat fairness—accused must understand substance and be heard.

Thus, trial formats represent “procedural proportionality”: more serious charge → more rigorous process.

BNSS’s design integrates speed with legally controlled discretion—ideal exam point.

Zahira Habibullah Sheikh v. State of Gujarat (2004) 4 SCC 158.

State of Punjab v. Gurmit Singh (1996) 2 SCC 384.

Rattiram v. State of M.P. (2012) 4 SCC 516.

P. Ramachandra Rao v. State of Karnataka (2002) 4 SCC 578.

Hussainara Khatoon (I) v. State of Bihar (1980) 1 SCC 81.

6. Conclusion

Sessions/warrant/summons procedures scale safeguards to offence gravity.

Summary trials are a lawful speed tool with caps and conversion safeguard.

The objective remains fair adjudication with minimum delay.

8) Compounding of offences + plea bargaining + concurrent/consecutive sentences (with interpretations)

1. Synopsis
Compounding ends prosecution by lawful compromise for specified offences, while plea bargaining is a structured negotiated disposition under court supervision. BNSS also clarifies when multiple punishments run concurrently or consecutively.

2. Introduction

Compounding is victim/complainant driven and offence-specific.

Plea bargaining is court-regulated negotiation with exclusions (serious/socio-economic/women/children).

Sentencing concurrency rules prevent chaos in multiple convictions.

3. Laws/Statutes

BNSS s.359: compounding of offences (table-based).

BNSS Ch. XXIII ss.289–300: plea bargaining.

BNSS s.25: concurrent/consecutive punishments; 20-year cap and “twice competence” cap.

Constitution: Art. 21 fairness; Art. 20(2) double jeopardy principle context.

4. Answer body

Compounding is permitted only for offences listed in BNSS table and by specified persons; it results in termination like acquittal effect.

It is distinct from quashing: compounding is statutory; quashing is inherent power doctrine (judge-made).

Plea bargaining applies only where punishment is not death/life/over 7 years and is excluded for offences against women/children and socio-economic offences.

Accused must apply within 30 days from framing of charge and file affidavit of voluntariness.

Court examines accused in camera to verify voluntariness, ensuring fairness and preventing coercion.

Court may allow up to 60 days for mutually satisfactory disposition including victim compensation.

Judgment in plea bargaining has statutory finality with limited constitutional remedies (Arts. 136, 226, 227).

Concurrent vs consecutive sentences arise when multiple offences are tried together; court orders mode considering gravity.

BNSS places important caps: consecutive total cannot exceed 20 years, and cannot exceed twice what court could impose for a single offence.

Concurrency avoids disproportionate punishment where offences are part of the same transaction; consecutiveness reflects distinct harms.

Judicial interpretation stresses reasons and proportionality to avoid sentencing arbitrariness.

Together, compounding/plea bargaining reduce pendency, while concurrency rules maintain sentencing rationality.

5. Case laws (5)

Gian Singh v. State of Punjab (2012) 10 SCC 303.

Narinder Singh v. State of Punjab (2014) 6 SCC 466.

Damodar S. Prabhu v. Sayed Babalal H. (2010) 5 SCC 663.

Muthuramalingam v. State (2016) 8 SCC 313.

O.M. Cherian v. State of Kerala (2015) 2 SCC 501.

6. Conclusion

Compounding is statutory compromise; plea bargaining is structured negotiated justice under court oversight.

BNSS concurrency rules impose principled caps to prevent sentencing excess.

These mechanisms collectively serve “nyaya” by reducing delay with fairness.

9) Appeals, Revision, Reference + security for peace/good behaviour + maintenance (alteration/enforcement)

1. Synopsis
Appeal is a statutory rehearing/correction mechanism, while revision/reference are supervisory correctness tools. Security proceedings prevent future breaches of peace, and maintenance provisions deliver social justice through summary remedies.

2. Introduction

Remedies ensure error-correction and uniformity of law.

Preventive jurisdiction protects community peace before crime occurs.

Maintenance protects vulnerable dependents from destitution.

3. Laws/Statutes

BNSS Ch. XXXI Appeals ss.413–435; victim’s appeal right included in s.413 proviso.

BNSS Ch. XXXII Reference & Revision ss.436–445.

BNSS security proceedings (scheme: “keeping peace/good behaviour” referenced in appeal s.414).

BNSS maintenance chapter (locatable via “maintenance of wives/children/parents” headings—scheme).

4. Answer body

Appeal is not inherent; it exists only when BNSS/other law provides.

BNSS also strengthens victim participation by granting victim a right to appeal against acquittal/lesser conviction/inadequate compensation.

Revision is a discretionary supervisory power to correct jurisdictional error, illegality, or material irregularity.

Reference is a mechanism where subordinate court refers legal doubt to High Court for authoritative resolution.

Appeal generally involves broader reappraisal; revision is narrower and prevents miscarriage of justice while respecting finality.

Security for peace/good behaviour is preventive: it binds individuals to maintain order through bonds/sureties.

These proceedings are not punishment for past act alone; they are preventive restraints justified by risk assessment and due process.

Maintenance proceedings provide quick relief to wives/children/parents, reflecting constitutional social justice and dignity.

Alteration/enforcement ensures orders remain realistic with changing circumstances and ensures compliance through legal coercion.

Courts emphasise that maintenance is a measure of preventing vagrancy and protecting dignity.

Remedies and preventive provisions together show BNSS’s dual role: corrective justice and preventive justice.

Proper use reduces litigation fatigue by giving finality with checks against miscarriage.

Madhu Limaye v. State of Maharashtra (1977) 4 SCC 551.

Amit Kapoor v. Ramesh Chander (2012) 9 SCC 460.

K. Chinnaswamy Reddy v. State of A.P. AIR 1962 SC 1788.

Bhuwan Mohan Singh v. Meena (2015) 6 SCC 353.

Shamima Farooqui v. Shahid Khan (2015) 5 SCC 705.

6. Conclusion

Appeals/revision/reference ensure legality, uniformity, and justice correction.

Security and maintenance reflect preventive + welfare dimensions of criminal procedure.

BNSS integrates victim rights and timely justice while preserving supervisory safeguards.
