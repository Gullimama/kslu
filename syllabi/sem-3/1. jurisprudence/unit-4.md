# Unit 4 — Legal concepts: rights, duties, ownership, possession, personality

## Question 1
Define “Right” in its strict legal sense. Explain the various kinds of rights with suitable illustrations. Distinguish between rights in rem and rights in personam.

### Synopsis
A right is a legally protected interest. Rights may be positive or negative, proprietary or personal, and may be in rem (against the world at large) or in personam (against determinate persons). Rights in rem correspond to duties owed by all; rights in personam correspond to duties owed by specific persons.

### Introduction
The texts treat rights as a foundational legal concept and explain their classification, especially the distinction between rights in rem and rights in personam.

### Statutes (laws verbatim)
- “A right in rem … corresponds to a duty imposed upon persons in general; a right in personam … corresponds to a duty imposed upon determinate individuals.”
- “A right in rem … is available against the world at large; a right in personam is available only against particular persons.”

### Body (detailed answer explanation)
1. **Meaning of right:** A right is an interest protected by law.
2. **Correlative duty:** Every right implies a corresponding duty on others.
3. **Positive rights:** Require performance by another (specific duty).
4. **Negative rights:** Require non‑interference (general duty).
5. **Proprietary rights:** Form part of a person’s estate/property.
6. **Personal rights:** Relate to personal status or condition.
7. **Right in rem:** Duty is imposed on persons in general.
8. **Right in personam:** Duty is imposed on determinate persons.
9. **Value difference:** Rights in rem are generally broader and more valuable.
10. **Creation modes:** Rights in rem often arise from relation to a thing; rights in personam from relation to a person.
11. **Illustration:** Right to possession of land is in rem; right to rent is in personam.
12. **Importance:** The distinction affects remedies, transferability, and enforcement.

### Case laws (5)
- **Armory v. Delamirie (1722)** — possessory right protected against others (in rem).
- **Moses v. Macferlan (1760)** — personal right to restitution (in personam).
- **Bromage v. Prosser (1825)** — injury to reputation as a legal right.
- **Bradford Corporation v. Pickles (1895)** — balancing property rights and interference.
- **Perry v. Clissold (1907)** — possessory title in law.

### Conclusion
Rights are legally protected interests. The distinction between rights in rem and in personam is central to legal classification, determining scope and enforcement.

## Question 2
“Possession is nine points of the law.” Explain the concept and various kinds of possession. Distinguish between ownership and possession with relevant case laws.

### Synopsis
Possession is the most basic relationship between persons and things. It is essential for social order and is protected by law. Possession is distinct from ownership: possession is factual and temporary; ownership is legal and more permanent. The law recognizes various kinds of possession, including immediate/mediate and constructive possession.

### Introduction
The texts emphasize possession as fundamental to human life and legal order, yet conceptually difficult to define. They also distinguish possession from ownership.

### Statutes (laws verbatim)
- “Possession of material things … is the most basic relationship between men and things.”
- “Possession differs from ownership in that the former is of temporary duration whereas the latter is of a more permanent, ultimate and residuary nature.”

### Body (detailed answer explanation)
1. **Basic relation:** Possession is the primary relationship between persons and things.
2. **Social necessity:** Without secure possession, social life would be chaotic.
3. **Legal protection:** Law protects possession to prevent self‑help and violence.
4. **Abstract concept:** Possession is difficult to define and is an abstract notion.
5. **Fact vs law:** Possession may exist as a matter of fact independent of law.
6. **Possession in fact:** Physical control or custody over a thing.
7. **Possession in law:** Legal recognition of possession, sometimes narrower or wider.
8. **Immediate vs mediate:** Immediate possession with holder; mediate through another.
9. **Constructive possession:** Legal protection without physical control.
10. **Ownership difference:** Ownership is legal, permanent, and a bundle of rights.
11. **Possession difference:** Possession is factual, temporary, and pre‑legal.
12. **Policy reasons:** Law may widen or narrow possession to serve justice.

### Case laws (5)
- **Armory v. Delamirie (1722)** — finder’s possession protected against all but true owner.
- **Bridges v. Hawkesworth (1851)** — possession and control of found property.
- **Perry v. Clissold (1907)** — possessory title recognized by law.
- **Winter v. Winter (1861)** — delivery/possession recognition.
- **Pickard v. Smith (1861)** — possession and liability principles.

### Conclusion
Possession is legally protected because it is socially indispensable. It is distinct from ownership, and its varieties reflect how law balances factual control with legal policy.

## Question 3
Discuss the concept of legal personality. Explain the status of the unborn, minor, lunatic, drunken persons, and dead persons from the standpoint of legal personality.

### Synopsis
Legal personality means being capable of rights or duties. Natural persons are human beings; legal persons are artificial entities recognized by law. The texts discuss persons who lack full personality (minors, lunatics, drunken persons) and those without personality (dead persons), along with special recognition for corporations and idols.

### Introduction
The texts define personality as the legal capacity for rights and duties, and distinguish between natural and legal persons.

### Statutes (laws verbatim)
- “A person is any being whom the law regards as capable of rights or duties.”
- “Persons … are of two kinds, distinguishable as natural and legal.”

### Body (detailed answer explanation)
1. **Core definition:** Personality is legal capacity for rights and duties.
2. **Natural persons:** Human beings recognized as legal persons.
3. **Legal persons:** Corporations and juristic entities recognized by law.
4. **Legal fiction:** Law can treat non‑humans as persons for legal purposes.
5. **Unborn child:** Limited recognition for protection of interests (e.g., inheritance).
6. **Minors:** Persons with limited legal capacity; rights exist but powers restricted.
7. **Lunatics:** Personality remains, capacity depends on mental condition.
8. **Drunken persons:** Temporary incapacity can limit liability or consent.
9. **Dead persons:** Personality ends at death; no rights or liabilities remain.
10. **Post‑death interests:** Law recognizes interests in body, reputation, estate via living representatives.
11. **Status concept:** Personality ties to status and legal condition in society.
12. **Policy basis:** Capacity limits are based on protection and justice.

### Case laws (5)
- **Salomon v. Salomon (1897)** — corporate personality.
- **Be Dean (1889)** — limits of legal personality for animals.
- **O'Shea v. O'Shea (1890)** — status and legal personality issues.
- **Bonham’s Case (1610)** — limits of legal authority and personhood concepts.
- **Winter v. Winter (1861)** — personal capacity and status.

### Conclusion
Legal personality is the capacity for rights and duties. The law recognizes natural and artificial persons and limits personality where capacity is lacking or at death, based on social and legal policy.
