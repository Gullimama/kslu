objectives:

    Any academic discipline, worthy of the name, must develop in the student the capacity for critical thought. Legal education needs to teach both law and its context- social, political and theoretical.

    At the heart of legal enterprise is the concept of law. Without deep understanding of this concept neither legal practice nor legal education can be a purposive activity. This course in Jurisprudence is designed, primarily, to induct students into a realm of questions concerning nature of law. Therefore, the first part of the course is concerned with important questions like, what is law, what are the purposes of law?, the relationship between law and justice and the like. The second part is concerned with the important sources of law. The emphasis is on important issues concerning law with reference to ancient and modern Indian Legal Thought.

    One important branch of Jurisprudence consists in analysis of legal concepts. The law of contract and tort is concerned with different rights which one person may have against another. Jurisprudence, on the other hand, studies the meaning of the term "rights" in the abstract and seeks to distinguish various kinds of rights which are in theory possible under a legal system. Similarly, it investigates other legal concepts and tries to build up a general and more comprehensive picture of each concept as a whole. This course is designed primarily on English model but native India Orientation is given wherever possible.
