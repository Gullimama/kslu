# Unit 3 — Sources of Law: legislation, precedent, custom

## Question 1
Discuss Legislation as a source of law. Explain the different types of legislation and distinguish between Supreme and Subordinate legislation.

### Synopsis
Legislation is the source of law consisting in the declaration of legal rules by a competent authority. In the strict sense it is law‑making by a sovereign or subordinate legislator. It is classified into supreme legislation (sovereign) and subordinate legislation (derived authority). Subordinate forms include judicial, delegated, local, and autonomous legislation.

### Introduction
The texts define legislation as the authoritative declaration of legal rules. This answer explains its concept, types, and the distinction between supreme and subordinate legislation.

### Statutes (laws verbatim)
- “Legislation is that source of law which consists in the declaration of legal rules by a competent authority.”
- “In the strict sense … legislation is the laying down of legal rules by a sovereign or subordinate legislator.”
- “Legislation is either supreme or subordinate.”

### Body (detailed answer explanation)
1. **Definition:** Legislation is declaration of legal rules by a competent authority.
2. **Wide vs strict sense:** Wide includes any law‑making; strict is rule‑making by sovereign or subordinate.
3. **Prospective character:** Legislators can lay down rules for the future without a dispute.
4. **Judicial contrast:** Courts make law only incidentally while deciding cases.
5. **Supreme legislation:** Issued by sovereign power and cannot be overridden by other authorities.
6. **Identification rules:** Legal rules define the sovereign body and legislative procedure.
7. **Constitutional limits:** Some systems impose legal limits on legislative competence.
8. **Subordinate legislation:** Made by authorities whose power is derived from the sovereign.
9. **Delegated legislation:** Rules by ministers or agencies under statutory authority.
10. **Local legislation:** By‑laws created by local bodies.
11. **Autonomous legislation:** Rules made by private bodies within delegated competence.
12. **Judicial legislation:** Judge‑made rules as a recognized subordinate form.

### Case laws (5)
- **Lee v. Bude (1871)** — parliamentary supremacy and legislation.
- **Bonham’s Case (1610)** — historical limits on legislation.
- **Marbury v. Madison (1803)** — constitutional limits on legislative power.
- **State v. Longino (1915)** — retrospective penal legislation concerns.
- **Charles v. Kempthorne (1930)** — legislative impact on expectations.

### Conclusion
Legislation is the most direct and authoritative source of law. Its classification into supreme and subordinate types explains the hierarchy and scope of law‑making in modern legal systems.

## Question 2
“Precedent is a source of law as well as evidence of law.” Explain the doctrine of precedent with reference to its binding and persuasive nature. What are the advantages and disadvantages of precedent as a source of law?

### Synopsis
Precedent is a distinctive feature of English law: judicial decisions are not merely evidence but a source of law. Precedents may be binding (authoritative) or persuasive. The doctrine promotes certainty and stability but can cause rigidity and delay reform.

### Introduction
The texts describe precedent as a core source of law in common‑law systems and distinguish between binding authority and persuasive influence.

### Statutes (laws verbatim)
- “A judicial precedent speaks in England with authority; it is not merely evidence of the law but a source of it; and the courts are bound to follow the law that is so established.”

### Body (detailed answer explanation)
1. **Meaning:** A precedent is the rule/principle laid down in a decided case.
2. **Authority:** In English law it is a source of law, not merely evidence.
3. **Binding precedents:** Must be followed within the judicial hierarchy.
4. **Persuasive precedents:** May guide but do not bind (lower/foreign/obiter).
5. **Certainty:** Ensures consistency and predictability in adjudication.
6. **Equality:** Like cases treated alike is secured through precedent.
7. **Efficiency:** Saves time by reusing established rules.
8. **Rigidity:** Strict binding can preserve outdated rules.
9. **Complexity:** Volume of cases can cause confusion and inconsistency.
10. **Delay in reform:** Correction often depends on legislation.
11. **Distinguishing:** Courts can avoid a precedent by factual differences.
12. **Exceptions:** Per incuriam and sub silentio weaken binding force.

### Case laws (5)
- **Beard v. Beard (1946)** — precedent authority in texts.
- **Younghusband v. Luftig (1949)** — inconsistent precedents.
- **R. v. Fulham Rent Tribunal (ex p. Zarek) (1951)** — per incuriam doctrine.
- **Armstrong v. Strain (1951)** — precedent treatment.
- **Lancaster Motor Co. v. Bremith Ltd. (1941)** — sub silentio doctrine.

### Conclusion
Precedent is both evidence and a source of law. Its binding force ensures certainty, but flexibility through exceptions is necessary to prevent injustice.

## Question 3
Explain Custom as a source of law. What are the essential conditions for a custom to be recognized as law? Distinguish between customs and conventions.

### Synopsis
Custom is an early and important source of law, though its role diminishes as legislation and precedent grow. Custom reflects long‑accepted practices that receive legal recognition. Customs may be legal or conventional; legal customs have force of law, while conventional customs are usages without legal binding force.

### Introduction
The texts describe custom as a historical source of law, particularly strong in early legal systems, and still recognized in limited form within modern systems.

### Statutes (laws verbatim)
- “Custom is an important source of law in early times … its importance continuously diminishes as the legal system grows.”
- “Even now custom has not wholly lost its law‑creating efficacy.”

### Body (detailed answer explanation)
1. **Definition:** Custom is long‑standing practice accepted by a community.
2. **Historical role:** In early law, custom was the main source of law.
3. **Modern position:** Legislation and precedent now dominate, custom is secondary.
4. **Moral authority:** Custom reflects the national conscience and public utility.
5. **Expectation:** Long practice creates expectations that law should honor.
6. **Legal custom:** Operates per se as binding law.
7. **Conventional custom:** Usage binding only by agreement or social practice.
8. **Recognition conditions:** Must be ancient/long‑continued.
9. **Certainty:** Custom must be definite and consistent.
10. **Reasonableness:** It must be reasonable and not opposed to morality.
11. **Legality:** Must not conflict with statute or higher law.
12. **Community acceptance:** Must be accepted as obligatory.

### Case laws (5)
- **Colombia v. Peru (1950)** — international custom recognition.
- **N. Ry. v. Sunburst Oil & Refining Co. (1932)** — judicial acceptance of practice.
- **Thabo Meli v. R. (1954)** — development of law where authority is absent.
- **Bromage v. Prosser (1825)** — customary principles in legal reasoning.
- **Assam Railways & Trading Co. v. I.R.C. (1935)** — authority and statutory context.

### Conclusion
Custom is a foundational but secondary source of law. It is distinguished from convention by legal enforceability and requires clear, long‑standing, reasonable practice to be recognized as law.
