# Unit 2 — Functions and purpose of law; justice; theories of punishment

## Question 1
Define justice and distinguish between different kinds of justice. Discuss the relationship between law and justice with relevant case laws.

### Synopsis
Justice involves fair distribution and balancing of interests. The texts explain justice as both formal (treating like cases alike) and material (deciding which differences matter). Law seeks justice but must balance it with certainty and stability. Civil and criminal justice pursue different ends, yet both rely on rule‑guided adjudication and reconciliation of competing interests.

### Introduction
The prescribed texts link justice with the operation of law, noting that law balances interests and must reconcile uniformity with flexibility. Justice is thus both an ideal and a practical requirement of legal systems.

### Statutes (laws verbatim)
- “Justice … provides an equitable division between the actual members of society. Once general rules … appear … a balance is beginning to be struck … between interests.”
- “The notion of law represents a basic conflict between two different needs, the need for uniformity and the need for flexibility.”

### Body (detailed answer explanation)
1. **Meaning of justice:** Justice is fair adjustment of rights, duties, and interests.
2. **Formal justice:** Like cases must be treated alike; it gives law logical consistency.
3. **Material justice:** Determines which differences matter (age, capacity, etc.).
4. **Distributive justice:** Equitable allocation of benefits and burdens in society.
5. **Corrective justice:** Restores balance when a wrong occurs.
6. **Interest‑balancing:** Law balances interests such as reputation vs speech or property security vs marketability.
7. **Role of general rules:** Once general rules exist, justice shifts from individual to abstract interest‑balancing.
8. **Uniformity value:** Uniformity gives certainty and predictability, enabling planning.
9. **Flexibility value:** Flexibility allows exception handling and social change.
10. **Law–justice tension:** Strict rules may cause unfairness; discretion may reduce certainty.
11. **Civil vs criminal justice:** Civil justice focuses on redress; criminal justice focuses on public wrongs and punishment.
12. **Institutional justice:** Courts apply rules and remedies to translate justice into enforceable outcomes.

### Case laws (5)
- **Bonham’s Case (1610)** — judicial scrutiny of unjust or unreasonable law.
- **Lee v. Bude (1871)** — debates on legal validity versus justice.
- **Marbury v. Madison (1803)** — judicial review as a justice mechanism.
- **Donoghue v. Stevenson (1932)** — corrective justice in negligence.
- **Rylands v. Fletcher (1868)** — distributive justice in risk allocation.

### Conclusion
Justice guides law, but law balances justice with certainty and stability. Legal systems achieve justice by applying rules that reconcile competing interests while remaining flexible enough to adapt to changing social conditions.

## Question 2
“The purpose of punishment is not vengeance but reformation.” Critically examine the various theories of punishment — Deterrent, Retributive, Preventive, and Reformative theories.

### Synopsis
Punishment is a social instrument. The texts explain that it protects society by deterrence, prevention, and reformation. Retribution provides moral justification but cannot be the sole aim. A workable system requires balance, not exclusive focus on any one theory.

### Introduction
The texts view punishment as both a social safeguard and an institution with moral justification. They emphasize balancing competing theories rather than pursuing a single aim.

### Statutes (laws verbatim)
- “Punishment can protect society by deterring potential offenders, by preventing the actual offender from committing further offences and by reforming and turning him into a law‑abiding citizen.”
- “The problem of punishment consists largely of the competing claims of these three different approaches.”

### Body (detailed answer explanation)
1. **Social purpose:** Punishment protects society, not personal vengeance.
2. **Deterrent theory:** Fear of punishment discourages potential offenders.
3. **Locke’s phrase:** Punishment makes crime an “ill bargain.”
4. **Preventive theory:** Incapacitates offenders to prevent repetition.
5. **Examples of prevention:** Imprisonment and disqualification orders.
6. **Reformative theory:** Aims to transform offenders into law‑abiding citizens.
7. **Modern trend:** Greater use of probation, parole, and rehabilitative methods.
8. **Retributive element:** Moral justification that punishment is deserved and proportionate.
9. **Critique of extremes:** Pure deterrence brutalizes; pure reformation weakens deterrence.
10. **Conflict of aims:** Deterrence, prevention, and reformation often pull in different directions.
11. **Need for balance:** A working compromise is required for effective criminal justice.
12. **Moral limit:** Punishment without justification is itself an evil.

### Case laws (5)
- **R. v. Prince (1875)** — mens rea and penal justification.
- **R. v. Tolson (1889)** — mistake and culpability.
- **Chisholm v. Doulton (1889)** — strict liability and mens rea debate.
- **State v. Longino (1915)** — retrospective penal liability.
- **Bratty v. Att.-Gen. (1963)** — mental state and criminal responsibility.

### Conclusion
Punishment is not vengeance. It is justified only when it protects society through deterrence, prevention, and reformation, all balanced with the moral legitimacy of proportional retribution.

## Question 3
Explain the functions and purposes of law in society. How does law maintain social order and promote justice?

### Synopsis
Law maintains order by providing certainty, predictability, and stability, yet it must remain flexible to adapt to social change. It balances competing interests and institutionalizes justice through authoritative rules and adjudication.

### Introduction
The texts portray law as both a stabilizing force and a tool for social adjustment, replacing private vengeance with institutional justice and enabling cooperation.

### Statutes (laws verbatim)
- “Uniformity is needed partly to provide certainty and predictability.”
- “There is a need for flexibility … to enable the law to adapt itself to social change.”

### Body (detailed answer explanation)
1. **Order maintenance:** Law replaces self‑help with institutional dispute resolution.
2. **Security:** Protection of possession and rights prevents violence and chaos.
3. **Certainty:** Uniform rules let citizens plan and predict legal consequences.
4. **Predictability:** Consistency in decisions promotes confidence in law.
5. **Justice function:** Law balances competing social interests.
6. **Corrective function:** Remedies correct wrongs and restore balance.
7. **Distributive function:** Law allocates rights and burdens across society.
8. **Social change:** Law adapts through legislation and judicial development.
9. **Flexibility:** Discretion is needed in exceptional cases.
10. **Stability:** Fixed rules provide social stability and order.
11. **Moral habits:** Law supports social morality through enforceable rules.
12. **Institutional authority:** Courts and legislatures give law binding force.

### Case laws (5)
- **Donoghue v. Stevenson (1932)** — creation of duty for social protection.
- **Rylands v. Fletcher (1868)** — risk allocation for social order.
- **Bradford Corporation v. Pickles (1895)** — balancing property interests.
- **Salomon v. Salomon (1897)** — commercial stability via personality.
- **Marbury v. Madison (1803)** — constitutional order through review.

### Conclusion
Law maintains social order through certainty and enforcement, and promotes justice by balancing interests and adapting to change. The texts emphasize that stability and flexibility together ensure law’s social purpose.
