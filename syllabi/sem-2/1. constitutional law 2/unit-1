Q1. Explain the federal system under the Indian Constitution. Discuss the organization of State and Centre–State relations (Legislative, Financial, Administrative).

1) Synopsis (2 sentences)
India adopts a federal structure with a strong Centre, combining division of powers with constitutional supremacy and judicial review. Centre–State relations operate through legislative lists, financial distribution, and administrative coordination to maintain unity with regional autonomy.

2) Introduction (3 points)

Federalism means dual polity + distribution of powers + supremacy of Constitution.

Indian federalism is often described as “quasi-federal” / “federal with unitary bias” due to Centre’s overriding powers.

The Constitution creates an “indestructible Union of destructible States” and makes federalism workable through coordination.

3) Laws/Statutes (3–4)

Arts. 1, 245–255 (Union/State legislative power; distribution; repugnancy; assent)

Seventh Schedule (Union/State/Concurrent Lists)

Arts. 268–281 (financial distribution; Finance Commission)

Arts. 256–263 (administrative relations; directions; Inter-State Council)

4) Answer body (10–12 points)

India is a Union of States (Art. 1): States are constitutionally created units; Parliament can reorganize States (Art. 3), showing Centre strength.

Legislative relations rest on Arts. 245–255 and the Seventh Schedule: Union and States legislate within their fields; Concurrent List allows both.

Doctrine of repugnancy (Art. 254) ensures Union law prevails in Concurrent matters unless State law has President’s assent (Art. 254(2)).

Centre has “residuary power” (Entry 97, Union List) and can legislate in State field during emergency / national interest / consent mechanisms (e.g., Arts. 249, 250, 252).

Financial relations: major taxes are assigned/distributed; Finance Commission (Art. 280) recommends tax devolution and grants to ensure fiscal balance.

Centre exercises control through grants (Arts. 275, 282) and centrally-sponsored schemes—creating functional interdependence.

Administrative relations: States must comply with Union laws; Union can issue directions to ensure compliance (Arts. 256–257).

Certain subjects require All-India Services (Art. 312) to maintain uniform administration and national standards.

Inter-State coordination: disputes go to Supreme Court (Art. 131); Inter-State Council (Art. 263) supports cooperative decision-making.

Federalism in India is dynamic: it aims at national integrity while allowing regional governance through constitutionally structured autonomy.

Judicial review protects federal balance by checking both Union overreach and State deviation.

Thus, India operates a cooperative, integrated federal system with constitutional distribution and Centre-tilt safeguards.

Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala (1973) — (1973) 4 SCC 225

6) Conclusion (3 points)

Indian federalism is constitutionally federal but functionally Centre-strong.

Legislative, financial, and administrative arrangements ensure unity with workable autonomy.

Courts preserve the federal balance as part of the constitutional framework.

Q2. Critically examine Co-operative Federalism. Discuss Freedom of Trade & Commerce and Official Language with case laws.

1) Synopsis
Co-operative federalism reflects shared governance, where Union and States coordinate to achieve constitutional goals. Part XIII protects economic unity through free trade, subject to reasonable regulatory/tax exceptions.

2) Introduction

Co-operation is necessary because governance problems are inter-jurisdictional (finance, infrastructure, welfare).

The Constitution embeds co-operation via councils, commissions, and fiscal devolution.

Economic unity is protected by Part XIII (Arts. 301–307).

3) Laws/Statutes

Arts. 263, 280 (Inter-State Council; Finance Commission)

Arts. 301–307 (trade, commerce & intercourse)

Arts. 343–351 (Official language; linguistic safeguards)

Art. 256–257 (administrative coordination)

4) Answer body

Co-operative federalism means non-competitive, coordinated exercise of powers to achieve constitutional governance.

It is implemented via Finance Commission devolution, GST-type harmonisation, planning/implementation coordination, and inter-state forums.

The Centre’s dominance risks turning co-operation into centralisation by conditional funding; thus, co-operation must remain consultative, not coercive.

Art. 301 guarantees freedom of trade/commerce/intercourse across India—core to economic integration.

Restrictions are allowed: Parliament (Art. 302) can impose restrictions in public interest; States (Art. 304) can impose reasonable restrictions and non-discriminatory taxes (subject to constitutional conditions).

The key judicial distinction: a direct and immediate restriction on trade violates Art. 301 unless saved; regulatory measures facilitating trade are permissible.

Compensatory/regulatory taxes have been judicially tested to protect free flow while allowing fiscal needs.

Official language scheme balances national link language with linguistic federalism: Hindi in Devanagari + continued use of English as provided, and state autonomy for official purposes.

Arts. 350A/350B protect linguistic minorities, strengthening cooperative unity without cultural suppression.

Thus, co-operative federalism + Part XIII + language provisions together secure unity, mobility, and pluralism.

5) Case laws

Atiabari Tea Co. v. State of Assam (1961) — AIR 1961 SC 232; (1961) 1 SCR 809

Automobile Transport (Rajasthan) Ltd. v. State of Rajasthan (1962) — AIR 1962 SC 1406; (1963) 1 SCR 491

Jindal Stainless Ltd. v. State of Haryana (2016) — (2016) 11 SCC 1

S.R. Bommai v. Union of India (1994) — (1994) 3 SCC 1

T.M.A. Pai Foundation v. State of Karnataka (2002) — (2002) 8 SCC 481 (pluralism/linguistic rights context)

6) Conclusion

Co-operative federalism is a constitutional necessity for effective governance.

Part XIII maintains economic unity while allowing limited, structured restrictions.

Language provisions constitutionalise unity without uniformity.

Q3. Local self-government (73rd/74th). Examine Art. 370 and Arts. 371-A to 371-J.

1) Synopsis
The 73rd and 74th Amendments constitutionalised grass-roots democracy through Panchayats and Municipalities. Special provisions like Art. 370 (J&K) and Arts. 371-A to 371-J reflect asymmetric federalism to accommodate regional diversity.

2) Introduction

Local bodies became a constitutional tier to deepen democracy and service delivery.

Special status provisions address historical, cultural, and administrative uniqueness.

These provisions aim at integration with accommodation.

3) Laws/Statutes

Part IX (Arts. 243–243O) — Panchayats (73rd Amendment)

Part IX-A (Arts. 243P–243ZG) — Municipalities (74th Amendment)

Art. 370 (J&K—special arrangement; now made inoperative by 2019 measures upheld in 2023)

Arts. 371-A to 371-J (special provisions for specific States)

4) Answer body

The 73rd Amendment gives constitutional status to Gram Sabha, elected Panchayats, fixed tenure, reservations, and State Election Commission mechanisms.

It mandates decentralised governance and planning through District Planning Committees/State Finance Commission support.

The 74th Amendment similarly constitutionalises Urban Local Bodies, wards, municipal functions, and metropolitan planning.

Together, they operationalise democratic decentralisation and participatory governance.

Art. 370 historically provided a special constitutional arrangement for J&K through Presidential Orders and concurrence mechanisms.

The Supreme Court has upheld continued operation/modification power historically and later adjudicated the 2019 measures.

Arts. 371-A to 371-J provide tailor-made safeguards (customary laws, land protections, regional development boards, etc.) to protect local identity and governance needs.

Such asymmetry is consistent with Indian federalism because the Constitution itself designs differentiated integration.

The constitutional theme is: strengthen democracy at the bottom and accommodate diversity at the periphery without breaking national unity.

Hence, local self-government and special provisions together reflect constitutional pluralism.

5) Case laws

Sampat Prakash v. State of J&K (1969) — (1969) 1 SCC 562

Mohd. Maqbool Damnoo v. State of J&K (1972) — (1972) 1 SCC 536

In Re: Article 370 of the Constitution (2023) — 2023 INSC 1058; 2023 SCC OnLine SC 1647

Kuldip Nayar v. Union of India (2006) — (2006) 7 SCC 1 (federal features)

Rameshwar Prasad v. Union of India (2006) — (2006) 2 SCC 1 (federal democracy)

6) Conclusion

73rd/74th Amendments make democracy participatory and local.

Art. 370 and Arts. 371-A to 371-J illustrate asymmetric federalism for unity with diversity.

The Constitution thereby balances decentralisation, integration, and regional safeguards.
