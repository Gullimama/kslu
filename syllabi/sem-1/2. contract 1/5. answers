Specific performance — when granted / not granted; who may obtain and against whom. (Specific Relief Act, 1963)

    Synopsis

        Nature: equitable, now largely statutory; aims to compel actual performance where damages are inadequate.
        Grant: subject to statutory conditions (readiness & willingness, certainty, possibility, mutuality, no legal bars).
        Refusal: personal service, determinable contracts, continuous supervision, uncertain/vague terms, hardship/inequity.
        Parties: who may obtain (s.15) and against whom (commonly treated via s.19), including subsequent transferees with notice. 

    Introduction

        Specific performance is ordered when monetary compensation cannot put the plaintiff in the same position—classically for unique property (immovable land) or specially bargained-for performance. Courts enforce the bargain only when statutory pre-conditions are met and no bars apply.

    Law & statutory hooks (short wordings)

        s.9: Defences under the Contract Act available.
        s.10: (Post-amendment sense) Specific performance shall be enforced subject to exceptions; historically grounded in inadequacy of damages.
        s.11–13: Special cases (trusts; titles; part performance under TPA s.53A).
        s.14: Contracts not specifically enforceable (e.g., personal service, determinable contracts, acts needing constant supervision, uncertain terms).
        s.15: Who may obtain: parties, representatives, beneficiaries (incl. reversioners, companies through promoters, etc.).
        s.16: Personal bars—plaintiff must plead/prove readiness & willingness; no default; no inequitable conduct.
        s.21: Court may award compensation in addition to or in substitution for specific performance.
        s.24: Bars where plaintiff cannot claim inconsistent reliefs or where other statutory bars apply.
        (Commonly paired) s.19: Against whom: the other party and persons claiming under him, including subsequent transferees for value with notice; bona fide purchaser without notice is protected.

    Explanation & application

        When specific performance is generally granted
            Damages inadequate / uniqueness: sale of immovable property; rare/unique chattels; bespoke subject-matter.
            Valid, certain, and enforceable contract: terms clear; consideration lawful; performance possible.
            Readiness & willingness (s.16(c)): continuous readiness from date of contract till decree (plead + prove).
            Mutuality & fairness: no unconscionable bargain; equities balance in plaintiff’s favour.
        When it is refused (key bars)
            Determinable contracts (terminable at will/pleasure): not specifically enforceable (s.14).
            Contracts of personal service or dependent on personal qualifications (s.14).
            Continuous supervision by court required (building/ongoing operation) unless terms are precise/manageable (s.14).
            Uncertainty/Vagueness: essential terms unsettled (price, subject-matter, timeline).
            Hardship/inequity at decree stage and plaintiff’s default or laches (links to s.16 personal bars).
        Who may obtain & against whom
            Who (s.15): the promisee, representatives/assigns, beneficiaries under settlements, companies through promoters’ preliminary contracts (if adopted), etc.
            Against whom (read with s.19): the promisor and those claiming under him; subsequent transferees with notice (specific performance binds them); BFP without notice is shielded.
        Practical exam pointers
            Always plead readiness & willingness + attach evidence (earnest payments, correspondence).
            In land-sale suits: discuss time-is-of-essence (usually not in immovable property unless expressly so or circumstances show), then tackle section 14 bars and s.19 against subsequent purchasers.

    Five must-cite case laws

        N.P. Thirugnanam v Dr. R. Jagan Mohan Rao (SC) — Plaintiff must continuously be ready & willing (s.16(c)); burden is real, not formal.
        Chand Rani v Kamal Rani (SC) — Time is generally not of the essence in sales of immovable property unless clearly stipulated or inferred from circumstances; impacts grant/refusal.
        Indian Oil Corp. v Amritsar Gas Service (SC) — Determinable contract → no specific performance; only appropriate monetary relief.
        Durga Prasad v Deep Chand (SC) — Decree of specific performance may run against subsequent transferees; court can direct them to join the conveyance (subject to BFP without notice protection).
        K. Narendra v Riviera Apartments (P) Ltd. (SC) — Court may refuse specific performance where enforcement would be inequitable or cause undue hardship disproportionate to benefit.
        (Helpful adjunct for negative covenants: Gujarat Bottling Co. v Coca-Cola Co. — injunction to hold parties to a subsisting negative stipulation.)

    Conclusion

        Grant of specific performance turns on (i) adequacy of damages, (ii) statutory bars (s.14), (iii) plaintiff’s readiness & willingness (s.16), and (iv) equities. Relief can bind successors/notice-holders, but determinable/personal/uncertain contracts are out. Courts may couple or substitute damages under s.21.

Injunctions — temporary, perpetual, mandatory; when granted/refused (Specific Relief Act, 1963).

    Synopsis

        Preventive relief (SRA s.36) is given by injunctions.
        Temporary injunctions (SRA s.37(1) + CPC Order 39 Rules 1–2) protect the status quo till trial; test = prima facie case + balance of convenience + irreparable injury.
        Perpetual injunctions (s.38) are final decrees to prevent breach of an obligation (esp. rights in property).
        Mandatory injunctions (s.39) compel positive acts to restore things to their former state/undo a breach; applied sparingly.
        Refusals (s.41) include: adequate damages, enforce negative covenant during subsistence only, hardship, etc. Damages with/for injunction (s.40).

    Introduction

        Injunctions are equitable, discretionary tools to prevent or undo harm. Courts guard against both irremediable injury and abuse of injunctions by insisting on structured tests and the bars in s.41.

    Law & statutory hooks (short wordings)

        s.36: Preventive relief by injunction.
        s.37: Temporary (till a specified time/further orders; governed by CPC O.39 Rr.1–2) vs Perpetual (by decree on merits).
        s.38: Court may grant perpetual injunction to prevent breach of obligation, incl. to protect possession/ownership, easements, nuisance, etc.
        s.39: Mandatory injunction to prevent breach by compelling performance of certain acts.
        s.40: Court may award damages in addition to or in substitution for injunction.
        s.41: When injunction cannot be granted (illustratively): to restrain judicial proceedings (save exceptions), to restrain breach where equally efficacious relief by damages exists, to enforce a contract not specifically enforceable, to prevent breach of a negative covenant after contract has ended, against trifles, etc.
        s.42 (classic head): Injunction to perform negative agreements (e.g., not to compete) during the subsistence of the contract.

    Explanation & application

        A. Temporary injunctions (interim relief)
            Purpose: preserve status quo and prevent irreparable harm before trial.
            Three-part test (judge-made, echoed repeatedly):
                Prima facie case (serious question to try);
                Balance of convenience in favour of applicant;
                Irreparable injury (compensation not an adequate remedy).
            Ex parte orders: exceptional; strict scrutiny and short return dates.
        B. Perpetual injunctions (final relief)
            Granted after trial when:
                There is a breach or threatened breach of a legal obligation/right, especially property rights;
                Damages are inadequate or multiplicity of suits likely;
                Relief is clear, certain, and enforceable.
        C. Mandatory injunctions
            Extraordinary; to undo an accomplished wrong or compel performance that preserves justice.
            Court looks for: a strong prima facie case, greater hardship if refused than granted, and the need to restore last non-wrongful state.
        D. Bars/refusals (s.41 highlights)
            Where damages are adequate;
            To enforce personal service/contracts not specifically enforceable;
            To restrain libel without clear case;
            To enforce negative covenants after contract ends;
            Where plaintiff is in delay/laches or has unclean hands.
        E. Negative covenants (s.42)
            Courts enforce “do not do” clauses during subsistence of the contract (e.g., exclusivity), but won’t create a back-door specific performance of a determinable contract.

    Five must-cite case laws

        Dalpat Kumar v Prahlad Singh (SC 1992) — Canonical 3-part test for interim injunctions: prima facie, balance of convenience, irreparable injury; no injunction on mere arguable case.
        Wander Ltd. v Antox India (P) Ltd. (SC 1990) — Appellate restraint: interim injunctions are discretionary; appeals interfere only on principle or perversity.
        Morgan Stanley Mutual Fund v Kartick Das (SC 1994) — Ex parte interim injunctions are exceptional; strict conditions and brevity.
        Dorab Cawasji Warden v Coomi Sorab Warden (SC 1990) — Mandatory injunction test: high standard—strong prima facie case, irreparable injury, balance of convenience clearly in favour; restores status quo ante.
        Gujarat Bottling Co. v Coca-Cola Co. (SC 1995) — Negative covenants: courts may restrain violation during subsistence of contract; highlights s.42 logic and s.41 bars.
        (Property-suit aid: Anathula Sudhakar v P. Buchi Reddy (SC 2008) — when to seek injunction vs declaration vs possession.)

    Conclusion

        Injunctions prevent or undo harm. Courts apply structured tests (especially for temporary/mandatory relief) and vigilantly observe s.41 bars to avoid over-reach. Perpetual injunctions protect enduring rights; mandatory ones correct accomplished wrongs—both granted only when damages are inadequate and equities favour the plaintiff.

        Remedies mix (s.40 damages with/for injunction; s.42 negative covenants during subsistence). 


Rectification of instruments, cancellation of instruments, and declaratory decrees — nature, grounds, and court’s powers (Specific Relief Act, 1963).

    Synopsis

        Rectification (Ss. 26 & allied principles): correct a written instrument that, by fraud or mutual mistake, fails to express the real intention; needs precise pleadings.
        Cancellation (s.31): cancel a void/voidable written instrument causing reasonable apprehension of serious injury if left outstanding.
        Declaratory decrees (s.34): declaration of legal status/right without consequential relief where adequate; court’s discretionary power, subject to bars.

    Introduction

        Courts protect parties from the mismatch between reality and paperwork (rectification), the cloud cast by defective instruments (cancellation), and uncertainty over status/rights (declarations). Reliefs are discretionary, guided by equity and the Specific Relief Act.

    Law & statutory hooks (short wordings)

        Rectification (commonly treated under SRA s.26):
            When, through fraud or (common) mistake, a written instrument does not express the parties’ real intention, court may rectify it.
            Requirements: clear pleadings of mistake/fraud; exact form of the instrument intended; court may grant consequential relief (e.g., specific performance as rectified).
            Limits: Unilateral mistake generally insufficient (unless fraud/knowledge by the other side).
        Cancellation (s.31):
            Person against whom a written instrument is void/voidable, and who has reasonable apprehension of serious injury, may sue to have it adjudged void/voidable and cancelled (whole or in part).
            Court may require repossession and deliver up for cancellation; may order annexure/endorsement; ensures protection of third parties.
        Declaratory decrees (s.34):
            Any person entitled to any legal character or to any right as to property may sue against any person denying/ interested to deny such title, and court may make a declaration.
            Proviso: Court shall not make a declaration where the plaintiff, being able to seek further relief than a mere declaration, omits to do so.
            Declarations are binding only on parties/privies.

    Explanation & application

        A. Rectification
            Mutual mistake/fraud must be proved with convincing evidence; the goal is to align the instrument with the true common intention.
            Typical: wrong boundary description, mis-typed consideration, swapped clauses, mistaken plot number.
            Court may rectify first and then grant specific performance of the rectified instrument (to avoid multiplicity).
        B. Cancellation
            Use when a void/voidable deed (e.g., forged, executed under undue influence, or incompetent party) threatens serious injury if left outstanding (cloud on title, risk of suits).
            Relief can be partial (cancel a clause) where severable; the court may direct delivery up for physical cancellation.
            Where a more suitable remedy exists (e.g., declaration + possession), the court weighs efficacy and equities.
        C. Declaratory decrees
            Appropriate to quiet title or settle status (e.g., legitimacy, adoption, easement, share).
            If further relief (injunction/possession/specific performance) is available and necessary, failure to claim it bars a bare declaration (proviso to s.34).
            Not a device to decide abstract questions; must be a real and present controversy.

    Five must-cite case laws

        Jagdish Singh v Natthu Singh (SC) — Rectification requires clear proof of common intention and mutual mistake/fraud; courts won’t re-write bargains.
        Loon Karan Sethia v Ivan E. John (SC) — On rectification standards and caution against altering substantive rights absent convincing evidence.
        Deo Kuer v Sheo Prasad Singh (PC) — Cancellation: when a void/voidable deed casts a cloud on title, court may cancel to avert serious injury.
        Satya Pal Anand v State of M.P. (SC) — Declaratory relief is discretionary; court considers whether further relief should have been claimed; no declarations for academic disputes.
        Smt. Ganga Bai v Vijay Kumar (SC) — Plaintiff must seek appropriate consequential relief where necessary; bare declaration may be refused under the s.34 proviso.
        (Handy pair if space allows: H. Ananda Reddy v Konduru Venkat Reddy—rectification details; Anathula Sudhakar v P. Buchi Reddy—when to sue for declaration/injunction/possession.)

    Conclusion

        Use rectification to fix instruments that misrecord the true bargain (fraud/mutual mistake). Use cancellation to neutralize harmful void/voidable instruments. Seek a declaration to quiet legal character/property rights, but remember the proviso—ask for further relief when you can.

    Memory peg

        “ReCaD ⇒ Proof–Peril–Proviso”
        Rectification: Proof of mutual mistake/fraud + intended terms, then SP as rectified.
        Cancellation: Peril (reasonable apprehension of serious injury) from void/voidable instrument.
        Declaration: Proviso—no bare declaration when further relief is available; keep it real, not academic.
