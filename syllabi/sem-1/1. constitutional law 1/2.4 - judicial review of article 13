1. Synopsis

Judicial Review under Article 13 empowers courts to invalidate any law—pre- or post-Constitution—that contravenes Part III (Fundamental Rights).
It upholds constitutional supremacy, the rule of law, and separation of powers by making the judiciary the ultimate arbiter of rights violations.
Critical Issues: Scope of “law,” limits on amending power (Shankari Prasad ↔ Golaknath ↔ Keshavananda), interplay with the basic structure doctrine, and the inclusion of Ninth Schedule laws (I.R. Coelho).

2. Introduction
Judicial review under Article 13 is the cornerstone of India’s constitutional democracy. By declaring any inconsistent law void, it ensures that Fundamental Rights prevail over legislation. This doctrine was indispensable to transition from parliamentary sovereignty inherited from colonial rule to constitutional supremacy, entrusting courts with the power to strike down laws that infringe citizens’ core liberties.

3. Meaning & Definition

Article 13. Laws inconsistent with or in derogation of Fundamental Rights
All laws in force in the territory of India immediately before the commencement of this Constitution, in so far as they are inconsistent with the provisions of this Part, shall, to the extent of such inconsistency, be void.
The State shall not make any law which takes away or abridges the rights conferred by this Part; and any law made in contravention of this clause shall, to the extent of the contravention, be void.
In this article, unless the context otherwise requires, “law” includes any ordinance, order, bye-law, rule, regulation, notification, custom or usage having in the territory of India the force of law.

Key Terms:
“Law” (Art 13(3)): Broadly includes statutes, subordinate legislation, and custom.
“Void”: Inoperative from the moment of enactment or inconsistency, subject to doctrines of eclipse and severability.

4. Main Answer Body

Aspect	Discussion
Scope of Judicial Review	– Pre-Constitutional Laws (Art 13(1)): void “to extent” of inconsistency; doctrines of eclipse apply.
– Post-Constitutional Laws (Art 13(2)): void ab initio if abridge/take away FRs.
“Law” under Art 13(3)	– Expanded by A.R. Antulay v. R.S. Nayak (1988) to include non-statutory and quasi-legislative acts if they carry “force of law.”
– Ensures all State actions are subject to rights scrutiny.
Limits on Amendments	– Shankari Prasad (1951): Amendments ≠ “law” under Art 13(3) → unreviewable.
– Golaknath (1967): Overruled → amendments are “law” → subject to Art 13 review.
– Keshavananda (1973): Introduced basic structure → some amendments beyond judicial reach.
Doctrine of Eclipse & Severability	– Eclipse: pre-1950 statutes inconsistent with FRs become inoperative, not erased.
– Severability: unconstitutional portions of any law can be cut down, preserving the rest.
Role of Basic Structure	– Art 13 review coexists with basic structure (Art 368): some constitutional amendments—though “law”—cannot abrogate core rights.
– I.R. Coelho (2007): Ninth Schedule laws post-1973 amendable if violate basic structure.
Judicial Remedies	– Writ jurisdiction (Art 32, Article 226) enables quick invalidation.
– Ensures effective protection of FRs against legislative and executive excesses.

5. Case Laws & Critical Analysis

Case	Citation	Verdict & Analysis
Shankari Prasad Singh Deo v. Union of India	AIR 1951 SC 458	Held: Constitutional amendments under Art 368 are not “law” within Art 13(3); hence, not subject to judicial review under Art 13. Analysis: Preserved parliamentary supremacy over amendments; criticized for under-protecting FRs.
Golaknath v. State of Punjab	AIR 1967 SC 1643	Held: Overruled Shankari Prasad; amendments are “law” under Art 13(3) and void if abridge FRs. Analysis: Strengthened judicial review, elevated FRs above amendment power; created constitutional crisis resolved by 24th Amendment.
Keshavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala	AIR 1973 SC 1461	Held: Parliamentary power to amend is limited by the basic structure (including fundamental rights). Analysis: Balanced FR protection with legislative flexibility; curtailed absolutism of Golaknath by permitting amendments outside basic structure.
I.R. Coelho v. State of Tamil Nadu	(2007) 2 SCC 1	Held: Laws placed in Ninth Schedule after April 1973 are subject to Art 13/basic structure review. Analysis: Prevented Ninth Schedule from becoming a legislative shield against judicial scrutiny; reaffirmed judiciary’s ultimate role in rights protection.
A.R. Antulay v. R.S. Nayak	AIR 1988 SC 1531	Held: “Law” under Art 13(3) includes not only statutes but also quasi-legislative notifications/orders with force of law. Analysis: Expanded scope of judicial review to cover all governmental actions that impinge on FRs, closing loopholes in Art 13 protection.

Critical Observations:
The dialectic Shankari Prasad ↔ Golaknath ↔ Keshavananda underscores the tension between parliamentary sovereignty and constitutionalism.
I.R. Coelho and Antulay exemplify the judiciary’s activist role in plugging gaps—ensuring all laws, written or delegated, abide by fundamental guarantees.

6. Conclusion
Judicial review under Article 13 is India’s safeguard against legislative encroachment on Fundamental Rights. From the early Shankari Prasad deferential stance through the Golaknath revolution to the basic structure equilibrium in Keshavananda, and the post-Coelho expansion to cover delegated legislation, the doctrine has evolved to ensure that constitutional supremacy and the rule of law remain unassailable. As Basu, Shukla, Pandey, Seervai, and Jain & Jain affirm, this power anchors India’s identity as a rights-based, constitutional democracy.


FINAL ANSWER: 
=============
1. **Synopsis**
   Judicial review under Article 13 empowers courts to invalidate any law—pre- or post-Constitution—that contravenes Part III (Fundamental Rights). It enforces constitutional supremacy, the rule of law, and separation of powers by making the judiciary the final arbiter of rights violations. Critical issues include the scope of “law,” limits on amendment power (Shankari Prasad ↔ Golaknath ↔ Keshavananda), interaction with the basic structure doctrine, and the status of Ninth Schedule enactments (I.R. Coelho) .

2. **Introduction**
   Article 13 is the linchpin of India’s rights-based order. By declaring any statute or subordinate instrument inconsistent with Fundamental Rights void to the extent of the inconsistency (pre-Constitution) or void ab initio (post-Constitution), it shifted India from colonial parliamentary sovereignty to entrenched constitutional supremacy, entrusting courts with the power to strike down infringing legislation and protect citizens’ core liberties .

3. **Meaning & Definition**
   **Article 13**

   > (1) All laws in force in the territory of India immediately before the commencement of this Constitution, … in so far as they are inconsistent with the provisions of this Part, shall, to the extent of such inconsistency, be void.
   > (2) The State shall not make any law which takes away or abridges the rights conferred by this Part; and any law made in contravention … shall, to the extent of the contravention, be void.
   > (3) In this article, unless the context otherwise requires, “law” includes any ordinance, order, bye-law, rule, regulation, notification, custom or usage having in the territory of India the force of law.

   * **“Law”:** Broad—encompasses statutes, delegated legislation, and judicial/customary norms with binding force.
   * **“Void”:** Inoperative—either suspended (pre-Constitution) or null ab initio (post-Constitution), subject to Eclipse and Severability.&#x20;

| **Limits on Amendment Power**          | • *Shankari Prasad* (1951): Held amendments under Art 368 not “law” under Art 13(3), thus unreviewable.  <br>• *Golaknath* (1967): Overruled—amendments are “law” and void if they abridge FRs; triggered the 24th Amendment.  <br>• *Keshavananda Bharati* (1973): Introduced basic structure—Parliament cannot amend core constitutional features, even via Art 368. |
| **Doctrine of Eclipse & Severability** | • **Eclipse:** Pre-1950 laws inconsistent with FRs become inoperative but not erased; may revive if inconsistency is cured.  <br>• **Severability:** Any unconstitutional provision—pre- or post-1950—may be severed, preserving the valid remainder if it can function independently.                                                                                 |
| **Role of Basic Structure Doctrine**   | • Judicial review under Art 13 coexists with the basic structure limits on Art 368.  <br>• *I.R. Coelho v. State of T.N.* (2007): Laws placed in the Ninth Schedule after April 1973 are subject to Art 13/basic structure review, preventing legislative immunization of rights-infringing laws.                                                                      |
| **Judicial Remedies**                  | • **Writ Jurisdiction (Arts 32, 226):** Enables citizens to move Supreme Court or High Courts directly for striking down offending laws.  <br>• **Declaratory Relief:** Courts declare inconsistent provisions void, providing immediate relief against legislative and executive excesses.                                                                            |

| *Shankari Prasad Singh Deo v. Union of India* | AIR 1951 SC 458  | Held Constitutional Amendments under Art 368 are not “law” under Art 13(3), hence immune from Art 13 review. Preserved parliamentary supremacy but limited FR protection.                                                                                                                               |
| *Golaknath v. State of Punjab*                | AIR 1967 SC 1643 | Overruled *Shankari Prasad*; held amendments are “law” and void if they abridge FRs. Strengthened judicial review but precipitated constitutional crisis, leading to the 24th Amendment.                                                                                                                |
| *Keshavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala*     | AIR 1973 SC 1461 | Introduced the basic structure doctrine: Parliament’s amending power under Art 368 is subject to protection of core values—democracy, rule of law, judicial review, federalism—ensuring certain constitutional features remain beyond repeal, thus balancing FR safeguard with legislative flexibility. |
| *I.R. Coelho v. State of Tamil Nadu*          | (2007) 2 SCC 1   | Held that Ninth Schedule laws enacted after April 1973 are open to Art 13/basic structure challenge. Prevented Ninth Schedule from serving as a legislative shield against judicial scrutiny of rights violations.                                                                                      |
| *A.R. Antulay v. R.S. Nayak*                  | AIR 1988 SC 1531 | Expanded the definition of “law” under Art 13(3) to include quasi-legislative notifications and directions that carry the force of law, thereby closing loopholes and ensuring all government action infringing FRs is subject to judicial review.                                                      |

**Critical Observations:**

* The evolution *Shankari Prasad* → *Golaknath* → *Keshavananda* reflects the dynamic tension between parliamentary sovereignty and constitutionalism.
* Post-Coelho and Antulay rulings underscore the judiciary’s proactive role in extending Article 13 review to delegated and Ninth Schedule laws, reinforcing the Constitution’s supremacy over all forms of state action.&#x20;

6. **Conclusion**
   Judicial review under Article 13 is the bedrock of India’s constitutional democracy. From the initial deferential stance to amendments in *Shankari Prasad*, through the robust FR protection in *Golaknath*, to the balanced basic structure doctrine in *Keshavananda*, and the post-Coelho expansion to delegated legislation, the doctrine has matured to ensure that Fundamental Rights remain paramount. As Shukla and Jain affirm, this power anchors India’s identity as a rights-based republic, safeguarding citizens against legislative and executive encroachment and upholding the rule of law.
