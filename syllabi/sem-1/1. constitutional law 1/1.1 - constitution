5. Case Laws & Critical Analysis
Case	Citation	Holding & Analysis
S. R. Bommai v. Union of India	(1994) 3 SCC 1; AIR 1994 SC 1918	Held: Presidential proclamations under Art. 356 are justiciable; centre cannot treat states as mere appendages; federalism is a basic feature. This curbed arbitrary use of President’s Rule and reinforced state autonomy. 
Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala	AIR 1973 SC 1461	Held: Federal structure and parliamentary democracy are part of the basic structure; Parliament cannot amend away these core features. Cemented the Constitution’s rigid-federal safeguards. 
Minerva Mills Ltd. v. Union of India	AIR 1980 SC 1789	Held: Struck down amendments granting Parliament unlimited power; preserved the harmonious balance between Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles—both rooted in Preamble and federal ethos.

Critical Analysis:
The quasi-federal design (strong centre with federal safeguards) has generally worked to hold a diverse nation together.
Emergency powers and residuary centralization have invited criticism for central bias, yet judicial review and rigid amendment procedures act as checks.
Co-operative federalism mechanisms (Inter-State Council) seek to mitigate centre–state tensions.

6. Conclusion
The Constitution of India, through its written, rigid, quasi-federal, and parliamentary design, deftly balances unity and diversity, central authority and state autonomy, rights and duties. Its length and detail ensure both clarity and adaptability. Landmark judgments—particularly S. R. Bommai—have fortified its federal character, ensuring that India’s constitutional framework remains resilient, democratic, and true to its founding ideals.
