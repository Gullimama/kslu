Explain the Doctrine of Severability and the Doctrine of Eclipse.

1. Synopsis
The Doctrine of Eclipse renders pre-constitutional laws inconsistent with Fundamental Rights inoperative (eclipsed) but not void, allowing revival if the inconsistency is removed.
The Doctrine of Severability permits a court to “cut out” unconstitutional portions of a statute—whether pre- or post-constitution—and uphold the remainder, provided it is functionally separable.
Both doctrines flow from Article 13 (which voids inconsistent pre- and post-constitutional laws) and uphold the supremacy of the Constitution without discarding entire statutes.

2. Introduction
Article 13 of the Indian Constitution guards Fundamental Rights by declaring all laws inconsistent with them void either to the extent of inconsistency (pre-constitutional laws, Art. 13(1)) or ab initio (post-constitutional laws, Art. 13(2)). Two key judicially-devised doctrines—Eclipse and Severability—allow courts to strike the right balance between constitutional supremacy and legal continuity.

3. Meaning & Definition
Doctrine of Eclipse
Definition: A pre-constitutional statute that conflicts with Fundamental Rights is eclipsed—its operation is suspended only until the inconsistency is cured (e.g., by constitutional amendment). It is not erased from the statute-book.
Source: Art. 13(1); see Bhikaji Narain Dhakras v. State of Madhya Pradesh (1955) AIR 781 SC
Doctrine of Severability
Definition: If part of a statute—whether enacted before or after 1950—is unconstitutional, the offending provision may be severed, and the balance of the statute upheld, provided the remaining text can function independently.
Source: Art. 13 read with judicial practice; see R.M.D. Chamarbaugwala v. Union of India (1957) AIR 628 SC

4. Main Answer Body
Feature	Doctrine of Eclipse	Doctrine of Severability
Scope	Applies only to pre-constitutional laws (in force before 26 Jan 1950).	Applies to both pre- and post-constitutional laws.
Effect of Inconsistency	Suspends operation of the inconsistent portion (“eclipsed”); law remains on the books and revives when inconsistency is removed.	Strikes down the unconstitutional section permanently; rest of the statute survives if it is separable and operative on its own.
Revival	Yes—if Fundamental Rights change or the conflict is cured, the law revives automatically.	No—the severed portion is gone; only the valid remainder remains.
Judicial Tool	Protects continuity of historic laws while enforcing rights—courts decline to treat them as void ab initio.	Preserves legislative intent in part—courts save as much of the statute as possible without rewriting it.

5. Case Laws & Critical Analysis

Case	Citation	Holding & Analysis
Bhikaji Narain Dhakras v. State of Madhya Pradesh	AIR 1955 SC 781	Held: Pre-constitutional laws inconsistent with Fundamental Rights are inoperative (eclipsed), not void ab initio. Once the inconsistency is removed (e.g., by 1st Amendment), the law revives. This preserves legal continuity while enforcing rights.
R.M.D. Chamarbaugwala v. Union of India	AIR 1957 SC 628	Held: In the Cinematograph Act, the offensive certification clause was severable. The Court “read down” the statute: struck the unconstitutional part, upheld the rest, ensuring the legislature’s broader intent was respected.
Golaknath v. State of Punjab	AIR 1967 SC 1643	Held: Overruling earlier view, the Court held constitutional amendments are “law” under Art. 13(2). Any amendment abridging Fundamental Rights is void. The offending amendment could not be severed—Parliament had to enact a fresh, compliant provision or use Art. 368 properly.

Critical Observations:
Eclipse respects historical statutes and avoids legal vacuum, but may shelter outdated laws until formally amended.
Severability maximizes legislative survival and rule of law, yet courts must carefully assess whether the remainder can truly stand alone without judicial policy-making.

6. Conclusion
The Doctrine of Eclipse and the Doctrine of Severability are twin pillars of constitutional adjudication under Article 13, balancing the supremacy of Fundamental Rights with legal continuity. Eclipse temporarily suspends pre-1950 statutes in conflict, whereas Severability surgically excises unconstitutional provisions from any law, preserving the remainder. Together, they exemplify the pragmatic, rights-protective approach envisaged by D.D. Basu, V.N. Shukla, J.N. Pandey, and other KSLU-prescribed authorities—ensuring that India’s legal order remains both just and stable.

FINAL ANSWER: 
=============
1. **Synopsis**

   * **Doctrine of Eclipse:** Pre-Constitutional laws inconsistent with Fundamental Rights become inoperative (eclipsed) but remain on the statute-book and revive if the inconsistency is removed (Art. 13(1)) .
   * **Doctrine of Severability:** Where any provision of a statute—whether enacted before or after 26 January 1950—is unconstitutional, the offending portion may be severed, and the remainder upheld, so long as it can function independently (Art. 13 read with judicial practice) .
   * Both doctrines flow from Article 13 and preserve constitutional supremacy without discarding entire enactments.

2. **Introduction**
   Article 13 safeguards Fundamental Rights by declaring pre-Constitution laws void to the extent of inconsistency (Art. 13(1)) and post-Constitution laws void ab initio if they “take away or abridge” those rights (Art. 13(2)). The doctrines of Eclipse and Severability enable courts to balance the supremacy of Part III with continuity of legislation, avoiding wholesale invalidation where only parts of a law offend constitutional guarantees .

3. **Meaning & Definition**

   * **Doctrine of Eclipse:**
     A pre-Constitutional law that conflicts with Fundamental Rights is suspended in operation—“eclipsed”—but not eradicated. It may automatically revive if the constitutional inconsistency is cured (e.g., by a valid amendment) .
   * **Doctrine of Severability:**
     If any section or clause of a statute—whether pre- or post-1950—is unconstitutional, that provision may be “read down” or severed, preserving the remainder of the enactment provided the residual text can stand on its own and reflects legislative intent .

| **Revival**                 | **Yes**—if the inconsistency is removed (e.g., by constitutional amendment), the eclipsed law revives automatically without re-enactment. | **No**—once severed, the invalid provision is permanently excised; only the valid remainder endures.                                         |

| **Bhikaji Narain Dhakras v. State of M.P.** | AIR 1955 SC 781  | Held that pre-Constitution laws inconsistent with Fundamental Rights are inoperative (eclipsed), not void. Upon removal of inconsistency (e.g., via valid amendment), the law revives. This doctrine preserves historical laws while enforcing rights (Shukla; Jain).                                                                                                  |
| **R.M.D. Chamarbaugwala v. Union of India** | AIR 1957 SC 628  | In the Cinematograph Act, the objectionable certification clause was severable. The Court struck down only the unconstitutional provision and upheld the remainder, respecting legislative intent and avoiding needless invalidation of the entire statute (Shukla; Jain).                                                                                             |
| **Golaknath v. State of Punjab**            | AIR 1967 SC 1643 | Overruled *Shankari Prasad*, holding constitutional amendments are “law” under Art. 13(2). Any amendment abridging Fundamental Rights is void. The offending amendment could not be severed—Parliament had to enact a fresh compliant provision or use Art. 368 correctly. This underscores that even amendments must conform to constitutional limits (Shukla; Jain). |

**Critical Observations:**

* **Eclipse** avoids vacuums by suspending only the conflicting portion of pre-1950 laws, ensuring administrative continuity.
* **Severability** maximizes legislative preservation, but requires careful judicial assessment to ensure the remainder can genuinely operate independently and reflect original intent.

6. **Conclusion**
   The Doctrines of Eclipse and Severability—rooted in Article 13—are complementary tools of constitutional adjudication. Eclipse temporarily suspends pre-Constitution laws that clash with Fundamental Rights, allowing them to revive once conflicts are removed. Severability, by contrast, surgically eliminates unconstitutional provisions from any law, preserving the valid remainder. Together, they uphold the supremacy of the Constitution while ensuring legal continuity, embodying the pragmatic, rights-protective approach championed by Shukla and Jain in Indian constitutional law.
