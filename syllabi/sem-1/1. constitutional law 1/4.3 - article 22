Explain the rights of the arrested person and the provisions on preventive detention under Article 22.

1. Synopsis

Article 22 provides two complementary safeguards:

Rights of arrested persons (Clauses 1–2): a clear right to be informed of arrest grounds, legal representation, and prompt judicial oversight.

Preventive detention regime (Clauses 3–7): a time‐limited, advisory‐board–checked scheme under which the State may detain on suspicion of threats to security or public order.

2. Introduction
Article 22 strikes a balance between individual liberty and the State’s need to prevent crime or unrest. Clauses 1–2 guard against arbitrary arrest and indefinite custody, while Clauses 3–7 recognize that, in exceptional cases, the Executive may detain preventively, subject to strict procedural safeguards and periodic review.

3. Meaning & Definition

“Protection against arrest and detention in certain cases”
(1) No person who is arrested shall be detained in custody without being informed, as soon as may be, of the grounds for such arrest, nor shall he be denied the right to consult and to be defended by a legal practitioner of his choice.
(2) Every person who is arrested and detained in custody shall be produced before the nearest magistrate within twenty-four hours (excluding travel time), and no such person shall be detained beyond that period without the magistrate’s authority.
(3) Clauses (1)–(2) do not apply to enemy aliens or those detained under a preventive-detention law.
(4) No preventive-detention law may authorize detention for more than three months unless an Advisory Board (High-Court–qualified members) reports sufficient cause.
(5) Persons detained preventively must be informed of grounds and allowed to make representations against the order.
(6) The detaining authority need not disclose facts prejudicial to public interest.
(7) Parliament may legislate additional conditions—classes of cases, maximum periods, and Advisory Board procedures.

Joginder Kumar v. State of U.P. (1994)
The Supreme Court held that police must record and communicate the reasons for arrest, inform a friend or relative, and produce the arrestee within 24 hours—laying down mandatory diary-entry and notification guidelines.

D.K. Basu v. State of West Bengal (1997)
While primarily an Article 21 case, the Court issued detailed arrest-and-detention guidelines (name-tags for officers, arrest memos with witness signatures, periodic medical checks, control-room notifications) to give effect to Article 22’s safeguards.

5. Preventive Detention Provisions

Scope: Applies only to laws enacted by Parliament under Clause 7.

Temporal Limitation: 3 months max without Advisory Board approval; Board must report “sufficient cause” to continue.

Right to Representation: Detainees must receive grounds in writing and an opportunity to represent against detention.

Public-interest Exception: Facts “against public interest” may be withheld, but core reasons must be disclosed.

Parliament’s Regulation: May specify classes of cases, extend maximum periods, and frame Board procedures—yet always within Article 22’s framework.

6. Landmark Judgments & Critical Analysis

Case	Citation	Holding & Analysis
A.K. Gopalan v. State of Madras	AIR 1950 SC 27	Upheld the Preventive Detention Act under Article 22(4)–(7) but stressed strict compliance with three-month limit and Advisory Board review. Signalled that Article 22’s safeguards are mandatory, not optional.
Joginder Kumar v. State of U.P.	(1994) 4 SCC 260	Mandated recording of arrest grounds, notification to third parties, and timely magistrates’ production—transforming Clauses 1–2 from hortatory text into binding police procedure.
D.K. Basu v. State of West Bengal	(1997) 1 SCC 416	Though anchored in Article 21, the Court’s detailed arrest guidelines operationalize Article 22, fortifying procedural fairness and curbing custodial abuses.
Ram Jawaya Kapur v. State of Punjab	AIR 1955 SC 549	Held that Article 22 cannot be suspended even during an Emergency (Art. 359), underscoring its status as a non-derogable safeguard.

Critical Observations:

Rights of arrest are not mere formalities but judicially enforceable mandates, with detailed police-station procedures.

Preventive detention—while recognized—operates under strict temporal and quasi-judicial review constraints to prevent executive overreach.

Article 22’s protections are absolute, surviving even national emergencies, reflecting the framers’ intent to shield personal liberty from all but the strictest, constitutionally-defined exceptions.

7. Conclusion
Article 22 embodies the Constitution’s dual commitment to liberty and public order. By guaranteeing clear, enforceable rights on arrest, and circumscribing preventive detention with time bounds, Advisory Boards, and representation rights, it ensures that even extraordinary State powers remain subject to procedural justice.
