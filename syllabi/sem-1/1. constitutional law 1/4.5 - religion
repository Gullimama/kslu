Explain the freedom of religion under Articles 25–28 and discuss the reasonable restrictions on this freedom. 

1. Synopsis

Article 25 guarantees to all persons the right to freedom of conscience and to profess, practice and propagate religion, but “subject to public order, morality and health, and to the other provisions of this Part.”

Article 26 gives every religious denomination the freedom to manage its own affairs, own and administer property, and establish & maintain institutions for religious & charitable purposes, subject to general laws.

Article 27 prohibits any tax “for the promotion or maintenance of any religion,” ensuring neutrality in State finance.

Article 28 bars religious instruction in institu­tions wholly maintained out of State funds, and makes attendance at such instruction optional in State-aided schools.

Reasonable restrictions under Article 25 allow the State to regulate economic, political or secular activities associated with religion (“public order, morality, health”) and to enact social-welfare or reform laws

2. Introduction
India’s secular Constitution both protects individuals’ freedom to follow their faith and limits religious practices where they conflict with public welfare. Articles 25–28 together create a balanced framework: empowering personal and denominational religious rights, while safeguarding public order, morality, health, and equality.

3. Meaning & Definition

Article 25.

Subject to public order, morality and health and to the other provisions of this Part, all persons are equally entitled to freedom of conscience and the right freely to profess, practice and propagate religion.

Nothing in this article shall affect regulation of any secular activity associated with religious practice, or prevent the State from making laws for social welfare and reform.

5. Case Laws & Critical Analysis

Case	Citation	Holding & Critical Analysis
Commissioner, Hindu Religious Endowments, Madras v. Shirur Mutt	AIR 1954 SC 282	Held that Article 25(2) permits regulation of secular, economic or political activities connected with religion (e.g., endowments), while protected the rituals themselves unless they threaten public order, health or morality.

Rev. Stainislaus v. State of Madhya Pradesh	AIR 1977 SC 268	Clarified that “propagate” under Art 25(1) includes freely spreading one’s faith, but does not extend to forced conversions; the State may prohibit conversions by coercion, fraud, or allurement in the interest of public order.

Bijoe Emmanuel & Ors. v. State of Kerala & Ors.	AIR 1986 SC 1773	Jehovah’s Witness children expelled for not singing the national anthem: held expulsion violated Article 25 (freedom to refuse practices contrary to faith) and Article 19(1)(a). Also affirmed under Art 28(3) that attendance at religious or quasi-religious rituals in aided schools is optional.

6. Conclusion
Articles 25–28 establish a comprehensive mandate: individuals enjoy broad freedoms of conscience and worship, denominations control their internal affairs, and the State cannot financially support any one faith. Yet these freedoms are not absolute: Article 25’s reasonable restrictions and Article 26’s subjection to other constitutional guarantees ensure that religious liberty coexists with public order, morality, health, and the rights of others. Landmark rulings—Shirur Mutt, Stainislaus, Bijoe Emmanuel—demonstrate the judiciary’s role in balancing these dual imperatives, preserving both diversity and the rule of law.
