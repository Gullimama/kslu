Examine the constitutional provision on Untouchability under Article 17, with reference to landmark judgments on its abolition and enforcement.

1. Synopsis
Article 17 abolishes “untouchability” and forbids its practice in any form, making enforcement of any disability arising from untouchability an offence punishable by law. 
Though originally directed at caste-based exclusion, Article 17 has been held to prohibit both State and private discrimination. 
Key Judgments:
Devarajiah v. Padmanna (1958 Kant 84) – narrowed “untouchability” to its historical caste-based sense. 
Prathvi Raj Chauhan v. Union of India (2020) – reaffirmed Article 17’s primacy over even later Acts (e.g. SC/ST Atrocities Act). 
Puttaswamy & Ors. v. State of Kerala (Sabarimala review, 2019) – held exclusion of women from Sabarimala temple as menstrual “untouchability.” 

2. Introduction
Untouchability—an ancient system of caste-based ostracism—was formally abolished by the Constituent Assembly through Article 17, effective 26 January 1950. By transforming a deep-seated social evil into a constitutional offence, the framers ensured that both the State and private individuals could be held liable for any discriminatory practice rooted in untouchability.

3. Meaning & Definition

Article 17. Abolition of Untouchability.
“‘Untouchability’ is abolished and its practice in any form is forbidden. The enforcement of any disability arising out of ‘Untouchability’ shall be an offence punishable in accordance with law.” 
Key Elements:
Complete abolition: No toleration of any form—public or private.
Offence: Any disability imposed by reason of untouchability is punishable.
Scope: Applies to both State actors and private persons.

4. Main Answer Body

Aspect	Detail
Constitutional Mandate	Article 17 sits in Part III (Fundamental Rights), thereby placing untouchability on par with the most sacrosanct guarantees (e.g., equality, liberty).
Enabling Legislation	• Protection of Civil Rights Act, 1955 (originally “Untouchability (Offences) Act”).
• Scheduled Castes & Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989—expanded penalties and procedural safeguards.
Private vs. State Action	Supreme Court has held that Article 17’s prohibition extends to private individuals; the State must proactively enforce abolition, not merely refrain from discriminatory laws.

Judicial Interpretation of “Untouchability”	Courts have construed “untouchability” narrowly as caste-based disability: exclusion from temples, wells, burial grounds; denial of communal amenities; social boycotts if they flow from the traditional caste hierarchy.
Interplay with Other Rights	Article 17 reinforces Article 14 (equality) and Article 15 (non-discrimination), while the Atrocities Act provides procedural machinery (e.g., special courts, reversal of burden of proof) to enforce the constitutional ban.

5. Case Laws & Critical Analysis

Case	Citation	Verdict & Analysis
Devarajiah v. Padmanna	AIR 1958 Kant 84	Held: Untouchability must be understood in its historical, caste-based context—not as any mere social boycott or personal ostracism. This prevents over-extension of Article 17 to all forms of exclusion, preserving legislative space for reasonable private associations. 
Prathvi Raj Chauhan v. Union of India & Ors.	(2020) SCC OnLine Kar 5407	Held: Even provisions of the SC/ST Atrocities Act, 1989 must comply with Article 17; if any law created post-1950 permits a disability akin to untouchability, it is void to that extent. Affirmed that constitutional supremacy trumps all enactments. 
Justice K.S. Puttaswamy Retd. v. State of Kerala (Sabarimala review)	(2019)	Held: Excluding women of menstruating age from temple worship amounts to a constitutionally prohibited form of untouchability under Article 17. Described “purity-pollution” stigma as a caste-style disability, firmly rejected by the Court. 
State of Karnataka v. Appa Balu Ingale	(1992) 1 SCC 549	Held: The Atrocities Act’s offences are procedural extensions of Article 17; convictions can follow upon proof of any act causing a disability on caste grounds. Courts have upheld special courts and reverse burden norms to ensure effective enforcement.

Critical Observations:
Devarajiah strikes a necessary balance—guarding Article 17 against over-broad reading while targeting the historic caste-based evil.
Prathvi Raj Chauhan reinforces that all subsequent legislation must heed Article 17, lest it inadvertently re-introduce untouchability in new guises.
The Sabarimala judgment demonstrates Article 17’s living character, capable of addressing even sex-based exclusions rooted in notions of “pollution.”
Enforcement depends on both constitutional courts (judicial review) and special statutes (PCR Act, Atrocities Act), but implementation gaps remain a challenge on the ground.

6. Conclusion
Article 17 is a bold constitutional guarantee that not only abolishes untouchability in all its traditional forms but also empowers the State and courts to punish any analogous disability. Through landmark rulings—Devarajiah, Prathvi Raj Chauhan, Puttaswamy (Sabarimala)—the judiciary has both refined the scope of “untouchability” and strengthened its enforcement, ensuring that India’s commitment to human dignity, equality, and social justice is both principled and practical.

| **Constitutional Mandate**      | Article 17 is part of Part III (Fundamental Rights), ranking untouchability’s abolition alongside core guarantees like equality and liberty, thereby embedding its prohibition at the heart of India’s constitutional order.                                                                                                                     |
| **Enabling Legislation**        | • **Protection of Civil Rights Act, 1955:** Originally the Untouchability (Offences) Act, prescribes penalties and procedures for offences under Art. 17. <br>• **SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989:** Expands substantive offences, creates special courts, reverses burden of proof, and mandates relief and rehabilitation measures. |
| **State vs. Private Action**    | The Supreme Court has held that Article 17 prohibits untouchability whether practiced by State agencies (e.g., exclusionary municipal by-laws) or private individuals (e.g., denial of entry to wells or temples), obliging the State not only to refrain but also to take affirmative measures for eradication.                                 |
| **Judicial Interpretation**     | Courts have confined “untouchability” to its historic, caste-based meaning—barrier practices such as forbidding use of common amenities, social ostracism, temple exclusion—thus preventing over-extension to all social boycotts while targeting the traditional disabilities of the caste system.                                              |
| **Interplay with Other Rights** | Article 17 reinforces Article 14’s equality guarantee and Article 15’s non-discrimination mandate, while the Atrocities Act provides procedural machinery—special courts, expedited trials, victim compensation—to ensure effective enforcement of the constitutional ban on untouchability.                                                     |

State of Kerala* (Sabarimala) | (2019)                     | Held exclusion of women of menstruating age from temple entry constitutes a form of caste-style “untouchability” rooted in purity-pollution stigma. Classified this as an Article 17 violation, demonstrating the provision’s living character in addressing newly recognized forms of discrimination. |
| *State of Karnataka v. Appa Balu Ingale*            | (1992) 1 SCC 549           | Interpreted the Atrocities Act as a procedural extension of Article 17. Upheld the validity of special courts, reverse burden of proof and enhanced penalties to ensure effective punishment of caste-based disabilities.                                                                              |

* *Prathvi Raj Chauhan* underscores that all subsequent legislation must heed Article 17, lest it inadvertently re-introduce untouchability.
* The Sabarimala judgment illustrates Article 17’s adaptability to novel exclusionary practices rooted in caste notions of “pollution.”
* Enforcement relies on constitutional courts and special statutes, but implementation gaps persist, highlighting the need for vigilant State action.&#x20;

6. **Conclusion**
   Article 17 stands as a powerful constitutional guarantee abolishing untouchability in all its traditional forms and empowering both State and courts to punish any analogous disability. Through *Devarajiah*, *Prathvi Raj Chauhan*, the Sabarimala review, and *Appa Balu Ingale*, the judiciary has refined the scope of “untouchability,” affirmed its application against all actors, and strengthened enforcement mechanisms—ensuring India’s commitment to human dignity, equality and social justice is both principled and practical.&#x20;
