2. Introduction
Originally a limited guarantee against arbitrary arrest, Article 21 has been transformed by the Supreme Court into the cornerstone of Indian constitutionalism. Through a series of activist rulings, the Court has read into “life” and “personal liberty” a host of subsidiary rights, ensuring that the State’s power to deprive is matched by robust procedural and substantive safeguards.

6. Conclusion
Article 21 has evolved from a procedural safeguard against arbitrary detention into a comprehensive charter of human dignity and autonomy. Through landmark rulings—Maneka Gandhi, Olga Tellis, Puttaswamy and the environment cases—the Supreme Court has ensured that life and personal liberty encompass a rich spectrum: from subsistence and shelter to privacy and ecological health. As D.D. Basu, V.N. Shukla, J.N. Pandey and other KSLU-prescribed scholars observe, this dynamic interpretation makes Article 21 the “heart and soul” of India’s constitutional promise.
