Explain Pre-Constitutional and Post-Constitutional laws.

1. Synopsis
Pre-Constitutional Laws are those “in force in the territory of India immediately before the commencement of this Constitution,” and under Article 13(1) they become void “to the extent of such inconsistency” with Fundamental Rights.
Post-Constitutional Laws are any statutes, regulations or orders made after 26 January 1950, and under Article 13(2) any such law that “takes away or abridges” Fundamental Rights is void ab initio.
Key Doctrines:
Eclipse (pre-Constitutional) – law becomes inoperative but not erased, and may revive if inconsistency is removed.
Severability – only the offending part of a statute is struck down, the rest survives.
Significance: Protects the supremacy of the Constitution, ensures all law—old and new—conforms to Part III, and empowers courts to strike down inconsistent provisions. 

2. Introduction
With the adoption of the Indian Constitution on 26 November 1949, it became necessary to determine how existing laws and future legislation would interact with the newly enshrined Fundamental Rights (Part III). Article 13 provides this bridge, declaring that any law—whether predating or post-dating the Constitution—that infringes Fundamental Rights is to be invalidated to preserve constitutional supremacy. 

3. Meaning & Definition

Article 13(1)
“All laws in force in the territory of India immediately before the commencement of this Constitution, in so far as they are inconsistent with the provisions of this Part, shall, to the extent of such inconsistency, be void.”
Article 13(2)
“The State shall not make any law which takes away or abridges the rights conferred by this Part; and any law made in contravention of this clause shall, to the extent of the contravention, be void.” 
Pre-Constitutional Laws: Existing Acts, regulations, orders, etc., as on 26 Jan 1950.
Post-Constitutional Laws: All legislation enacted by Parliament or State Legislatures after 26 Jan 1950, including subordinate legislation.

4. Main Answer Body

Feature	Pre-Constitutional Laws	Post-Constitutional Laws
Source	Laws in force before 26 Jan 1950	Laws made after 26 Jan 1950 by Parliament/States
Validity Test	Void only to extent of inconsistency (Doctrine of Eclipse)	Void ab initio if it “takes away or abridges” Fundamental Rights
Doctrine of Eclipse	Operative parts “eclipsed” by FRs but not erased; may revive if conflict removed 
Inapplicable—law struck down in whole where inconsistent, cannot revive
Doctrine of Severability	Offending sections can be severed, remainder upheld	Offending sections can also be severed; remainder upheld provided separable
Retrospective Effect	Does not apply retroactively to actions before 1950; past acts under law remain valid	Void from inception for all purposes
Amendments	Not applicable	Early view (Shankari Prasad): Amendments not “law” under Art 13(2); later (Golaknath) they are “law”

5. Case Laws & Critical Analysis

Case	Citation	Holding & Analysis
Shankari Prasad v. Union of India	AIR 1951 SC 458	Held: A Constitution Amendment Act under Art 368 is not “law” within Art 13(2)’s ambit—only ordinary legislation counts. Thus, the First Amendment (1951) abridging property rights did not fall foul of Art 13(2). 
Bhikaji Narain Dhakras v. State of Madhya Pradesh	AIR 1955 SC 781	Held: Pre-constitutional laws infringing FRs become inoperative (eclipsed), not void ab initio. Once the inconsistency is removed (e.g., via constitutional amendment), the law revives without fresh enactment. 
Golaknath v. State of Punjab	AIR 1967 SC 1643	Held: Overruling Shankari Prasad, the Court classified constitutional amendments as “law” under Art 13(2)/(3). Consequently, any amendment curtailing Fundamental Rights is void, prompting the 24th Amendment to restore amendment power. 

Critical Analysis:
The eclipse and severability doctrines ensure continuity and flexibility, allowing valuable pre-constitutional frameworks to survive subject to Rights.
The Shankari Prasad line preserved parliamentary supremacy over amendments, but Golaknath re-asserted constitutionalism by subjecting amendments to judicial review under Art 13, later refined by the basic structure doctrine in Keshavananda.

6. Conclusion
The distinction between pre- and post-constitutional laws under Article 13 safeguards India’s Fundamental Rights by subjecting all statutes—old or new—to constitutional muster. Pre-1950 laws are rendered inoperative only where they conflict (Doctrine of Eclipse), preserving governance continuity, while post-1950 legislation that infringes Rights is struck down ab initio, underscoring the supremacy of the Constitution and cementing judicial review as a core pillar of Indian constitutionalism.

FINAL ANSWER: 
=============
1. **Synopsis**

   * **Pre-Constitutional Laws** are those “in force in the territory of India immediately before the commencement of this Constitution” (Art. 13(1)); they become inoperative—eclipsed—to the extent they conflict with Fundamental Rights but revive if the inconsistency is removed (Doctrine of Eclipse).
   * **Post-Constitutional Laws** are statutes, regulations or orders enacted after 26 January 1950; under Art. 13(2) any such law that “takes away or abridges” Fundamental Rights is void ab initio.
   * **Key Doctrines:**

     * **Eclipse (Pre-Const.):** Conflicting provisions lie dormant, not erased, and may revive once the inconsistency ceases.
     * **Severability (Both):** Only the offending portion is struck down; the remainder of the statute survives if it is separable.
   * **Significance:** Preserves constitutional supremacy by ensuring all law—old or new—conforms to Part III, and empowers courts to invalidate inconsistent provisions (Shukla; Jain).&#x20;

2. **Introduction**
   With the adoption of the Constitution on 26 November 1949 and its coming into force on 26 January 1950, Article 13 was enacted to reconcile existing and future legislation with newly entrenched Fundamental Rights. It bridges pre-constitutional statutes and post-constitutional enactments, declaring that any law—whether predating or postdating the Constitution—that infringes Part III rights must yield to constitutional supremacy (Shukla; Jain).&#x20;

3. **Meaning & Definition**

   * **Article 13(1):**

     > “All laws in force in the territory of India immediately before the commencement of this Constitution, in so far as they are inconsistent with the provisions of this Part, shall, to the extent of such inconsistency, be void.”
   * **Article 13(2):**

     > “The State shall not make any law which takes away or abridges the rights conferred by this Part; and any law made in contravention of this clause shall, to the extent of the contravention, be void.”
   * **Pre-Constitutional Laws:** Encompass all Acts, ordinances, regulations and orders effective before 26 January 1950.
   * **Post-Constitutional Laws:** Include all legislation—Acts of Parliament or State Legislatures—and subordinate instruments enacted after that date.&#x20;

| **Doctrine of Eclipse**      | Operative parts eclipsed, not erased; once constitutional amendment removes inconsistency, law revives without fresh enactment.                                                                        | Inapplicable—conflicting provisions are void from the start and cannot revive, even if later amended to remove the inconsistency.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Doctrine of Severability** | Offending sections may be severed; the remainder of the pre-constitutional statute survives if separable and capable of functioning independently.                                                     | Offending sections may likewise be severed; the rest of the post-constitutional law survives provided it is not inseparably connected to the invalid portion.                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Retrospective Effect**     | Does not invalidate actions or rights acquired under the law prior to 26 Jan 1950; past actions remain valid.                                                                                          | Void from inception for all purposes—no protection for actions taken under the invalid provision.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Amendments**               | Pre-constitutional Acts can be amended or repealed; eclipse doctrine allows revival only by removing conflict.                                                                                         | Constitutional Amendments are “law” under Art. 13(2)/(3) (as held in *Golaknath*), and are subject to the same test—any amendment that abridges Fundamental Rights is void (subject to the basic structure exception). Early view (*Shankari Prasad*) differed but was overruled by *Golaknath* and *Kesavananda*. |

| *Shankari Prasad v. Union of India*       | AIR 1951 SC 458  | Held that a Constitution Amendment Act under Art. 368 is not “law” within Art. 13(2)’s ambit; thus the First Amendment (1951) curtailing property rights did not fall foul of Art. 13(2). Preserved parliamentary supremacy over amendments (Jain).                                                                         |
| *Bhikaji Narain Dhakras v. State of M.P.* | AIR 1955 SC 781  | Clarified that pre-constitutional laws infringing Fundamental Rights become inoperative (eclipsed), not void ab initio. Once inconsistency is removed (e.g., by constitutional amendment), the law automatically revives—a testament to the Doctrine of Eclipse (Shukla; Jain).                                             |
| *Golaknath v. State of Punjab*            | AIR 1967 SC 1643 | Overruled *Shankari Prasad* and held that constitutional amendments are “law” under Art. 13(2)/(3). Consequently, any amendment limiting Fundamental Rights is void. Prompted the 24th Amendment to restore Parliament’s power, leading ultimately to the basic structure doctrine in *Kesavananda Bharati* (Shukla; Jain). |

**Critical Analysis:**

* **Doctrine of Eclipse** ensures legal continuity by preserving pre-constitutional norms subject to constitutional conformity.
* **Severability** limits judicial interference to offending portions, maintaining legislative intent where possible.
* **Amendment Jurisprudence:** The shift from *Shankari Prasad* to *Golaknath* underscores India’s commitment to constitutionalism—subjecting even amendments to rights to judicial scrutiny, a principle later refined by the basic structure doctrine.&#x20;

6. **Conclusion**
   Article 13’s distinction between pre- and post-constitutional laws fortifies the Constitution’s supremacy by subjecting every statute—old or new—to the litmus test of Fundamental Rights. Pre-1950 laws are rendered inoperative only where they conflict (Doctrine of Eclipse), preserving governance continuity, while post-1950 enactments infringing rights are struck down ab initio, underscoring the Constitution’s primacy and cementing judicial review as a bedrock of Indian constitutionalism.&#x20;
