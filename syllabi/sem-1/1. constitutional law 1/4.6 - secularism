The 42nd Amendment (1976) formally inserted “Secular” in the Preamble; thereafter the Supreme Court declared secularism a basic feature of the Constitution in S.R. Bommai v. Union of India.

Judicial evolution has balanced religious freedom (Articles 25–28) with public order, morality, and equality, through landmark rulings such as Shirur Mutt, Rev. Stanislaus, and Bijoe Emmanuel, refining secularism into an active guarantor of pluralism.

2. Introduction
Secularism—state neutrality toward religion—was implicit in the original Constitution and made explicit by the 42nd Amendment of 1976. In response to India’s vast religious diversity, the framers and subsequent legislators sought to create a pluralist polity free from theocracy. Over time, the Supreme Court has interpreted, expanded, and enforced secularism, ensuring it remains a dynamic principle that both protects religious liberty and curbs sectarian excesses.

3. Meaning & Definition

Etymology & Essence: In the Indian context, secularism means that the State recognizes all religions but professes none, treating each faith with benevolent neutrality—no religious bias in legislation or administration.
