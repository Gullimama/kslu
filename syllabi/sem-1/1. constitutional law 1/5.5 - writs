Differentiate the various kinds of writs available for enforcement of Fundamental Rights (Habeas Corpus, Mandamus, Prohibition, Certiorari, and Quo-Warranto).

1. Synopsis

The Constitution empowers the Supreme Court (Art. 32) and High Courts (Art. 226) to issue five prerogative writs to enforce Fundamental Rights: Habeas Corpus, Mandamus, Prohibition, Certiorari, and Quo-Warranto.

Each writ has a distinct object and scope—from safeguarding personal liberty (Habeas Corpus) to ensuring lawful exercise of public office (Quo-Warranto).

Understanding their differences is crucial for effective public-law relief in India’s constitutional scheme.

2. Introduction
Articles 32 and 226 grant the apex and high courts respectively “the power to issue directions…writs” for the enforcement of Fundamental Rights. These writs—borrowed from English “prerogative writs”—form the backbone of India’s judicial review mechanism, providing swift, effective, and coercive remedies against unlawful state or judicial action.

4. Comparative Differentiation

Aspect	Habeas Corpus	Mandamus	Prohibition	Certiorari	Quo-Warranto
Object	Personal liberty	Performance of a public duty	Prevents unauthorised exercise of power	Corrects jurisdictional errors after decision	Challenges claim to a public office
State of Action	After (person is detained)	Continuing failure to act (duty unperformed)	Before (inferior court/authority acts in excess)	After (order has been passed)	Before or after appointment, to oust an unqualified office-holder
Against Whom	Any detaining authority (state/private)	Public authorities (statutory bodies)	Judicial / quasi-judicial bodies	Judicial / quasi-judicial bodies	Person usurping a statutory or constitutional office
Mandatory / Discretionary	Mandatory—court must inquire into legality of detention	Discretionary—court may issue if duty is clear and statutory	Discretionary—court may prevent excess jurisdiction	Discretionary—court may quash if order is without jurisdiction or violates natural justice	Discretionary—court may inquire into authority and vacate office
Typical Remedy	Release	Order to perform duty (e.g., register voter, issue license)	Stay or prohibition of further proceedings	Quash or set aside the impugned order	Removal of person from office; declaration of right of petitioner

5. Key Points

Habeas Corpus is the bulwark against arbitrary detention—often filed under Art. 32 or 226 to secure immediate freedom.

Mandamus cannot be used to enforce private or contractual rights; only public-law duties.

Prohibition & Certiorari form a two-stage check on inferior tribunals: Prohibition stops unlawful action before it issues; Certiorari wipes out unlawful decisions after the fact.

Quo-Warranto protects the integrity of public offices by ensuring office-holders meet statutory qualifications.

All writs flow from the same constitutional power, but their breadth and timing differ—making mastery of their distinctions essential for both litigators and administrators.

6. Conclusion
India’s five prerogative writs are tailored tools for swift, effective enforcement of Fundamental Rights and the rule of law. By understanding their distinct objects, timing, and procedural nuances, litigants and courts can deploy the most appropriate remedy—whether to secure liberty, compel duty, regulate jurisdiction, correct error, or uphold the sanctity of public office.
