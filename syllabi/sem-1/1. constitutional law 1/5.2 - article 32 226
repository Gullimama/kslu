Discuss the Constitutional Remedies for enforcing Fundamental Rights, including writ jurisdiction under Articles 32 and 226.

1. Synopsis

Article 32 is itself a Fundamental Right—the “right to move the Supreme Court” for enforcement of any other Fundamental Right—empowering it to issue habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, certiorari and quo warranto writs.

Article 226 grants High Courts concurrent—but broader—writ jurisdiction: they can issue the same five writs for enforcement of Fundamental Rights and “for any other purpose” (i.e. ordinary legal rights).

The right to constitutional remedies cannot be suspended (even under emergency), and is part of the basic structure of the Constitution.

Public‐law remedies have evolved to include compensation for breach of Fundamental Rights under both Articles 32 and 226.

2. Introduction
Part III of the Constitution not only guarantees substantive Fundamental Rights, but also provides effective remedies for their enforcement under Articles 32 and 226. Dr B.R. Ambedkar called Article 32 the “heart and soul” of the Constitution, ensuring judicial review and writ relief against any State action that infringes these rights.

Article 32.
“The right to move the Supreme Court by appropriate proceedings for the enforcement of the rights conferred by this Part is guaranteed. … The Supreme Court shall have power to issue directions or orders or writs … for the enforcement of any of the rights conferred by this Part.”

Article 226.

4. Main Answer Body

Feature	Article 32 (SC)	Article 226 (HC)
Justiciable Rights	Only Fundamental Rights.	Fundamental Rights + ordinary legal rights (“for any other purpose”).
Territorial Jurisdiction	Pan-India—writs enforceable throughout the territory of India.	Within territorial limits of the High Court, but may bind authorities outside if cause of action arose within jurisdiction.
Discretion vs. Obligation	Mandatory—Supreme Court cannot refuse to entertain any Article 32 petition.	Discretionary—High Court may decline writ relief even if rights infringed, though it ordinarily exercises jurisdiction liberally.
Concurrent but Superseding	Remedies under Article 32 are concurrent with Article 226; SC recommends petitioners first approach High Courts where remedy exists.	High Court orders stand unless superseded by a subsequent Supreme Court order under Article 32 or appeal.
Non-derogable	Cannot be suspended (Art 359) even during National Emergency.	Also immune from suspension; remains operative to enforce rights and legal redress.

5. Case Laws & Critical Analysis

Case	Citation	Holding & Analysis
Fertiliser Corporation Kamgar Union v. Union of India	(1981) 1 SCC 568	Held: Article 32 jurisdiction is part of the basic structure, since “it is meaningless to confer Fundamental Rights without an effective remedy.” Analysis: Cemented that judicial review and writ relief are indispensable to constitutional supremacy.

L. Chandra Kumar v. Union of India	(1997) 3 SCC 261	Held: Writ jurisdiction under Article 226—and the power of Judicial Review vested in High Courts—is also part of the basic structure. Analysis: Prevented Parliament from excluding High Court or Supreme Court oversight over constitutional validity of legislative or administrative action.

Nilabati Behera v. State of Orissa (J.S. Verma, J.)	(1993) 7 SCC 514	Held: The Supreme Court (under Article 32) and High Courts (under Article 226) can award compensation as a public‐law remedy for violation of Fundamental Rights—distinct from tortious relief. Analysis: Expanded the scope of “constitutional remedies” to include monetary relief for custodial excesses.
Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India	AIR 1978 SC 597	Held: Article 32 enables enforcement of the “procedural fairness” standard under Article 21. Analysis: Demonstrated that writ relief can protect substantive rights (life and liberty) by striking down arbitrary executive action.
State of Rajasthan v. Union of India (Public Interest Litigation)	AIR 1977 SC 1361	Held: High Courts may entertain PILs under Article 226 to enforce Fundamental Rights on behalf of disadvantaged groups. Analysis: Broadened access to constitutional remedies, making them more equitable and malleable in the public interest.

6. Conclusion
Articles 32 and 226 constitute the juiciable guarantee that Fundamental Rights are not mere “paper promises” but enforceable entitlements, backed by writ jurisdiction at both Supreme and High Courts. Through landmark rulings—Fertiliser Corporation, Chandra Kumar, Nilabati Behera—the judiciary has reinforced that effective remedies, including monetary compensation and public-interest petitions, are integral to preserving the basic structure and ensuring that constitutional rights remain meaningful and practical.
