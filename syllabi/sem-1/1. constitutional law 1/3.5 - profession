Explain the freedom of Profession, Occupation, Trade or Business under Article 19(1)(g) and the permissible restrictions on it.

1. Synopsis
Article 19(1)(g) guarantees to all citizens the right “to practise any profession, or to carry on any occupation, trade or business.” 
This freedom is not absolute: Article 19(6) permits reasonable restrictions—
In the interests of the general public,
By prescribing professional or technical qualifications, and
By creating State monopolies in any trade, business, industry or service. 
Judicial tests: restrictions must be (a) backed by a valid law, (b) serve one of the three permissible aims, and (c) bear a reasonable nexus to that aim.
Leading cases:
Chintaman Rao v. State of M.P. (1950) – struck down holiday laws for lack of reasonable nexus. 
Mohd. Hanif Quareshi v. State of Bihar (1958) – held that restrictions under Art 19(6) must not nullify the right. 
Sodan Singh v. New Delhi Municipal Committee (1989) – recognised street hawking as “occupation” yet subject to regulation. 
State of Tamil Nadu v. K. Balu (2017) – upheld highway liquor ban as a valid public-interest restriction. 

2. Introduction
Article 19(1)(g) enshrines economic liberty as a fundamental right, ensuring citizens can engage in lawful economic activities without undue State interference. Recognizing that unfettered economic activity can clash with public welfare, the Constitution’s architects included Article 19(6) to allow the State to impose reasonable restraints—striking a balance between individual enterprise and the common good.

3. Meaning & Definition
Article 19(1)(g)
“All citizens shall have the right— … (g) to practise any profession, or to carry on any occupation, trade or business.” 
Article 19(6)
“Nothing in sub-clause (g) of clause (1) shall affect the operation of any existing law, or prevent the State from making any law—
(i) prescribing for the professional or technical qualifications necessary for practising any profession, or carrying on any occupation, trade or business; or
(ii) requiring in the interests of the general public, the carrying on by State monopoly of any trade, business, industry or service, or the carrying on of any such activity subject to such conditions as may be specified in the law.” 
“Profession”: Occupation requiring specialized training/qualification.
“Occupation, trade or business”: Any lawful economic activity or enterprise.

4. Main Answer Body

Feature	Details
Scope of Right	– Includes setting up, running, and even closing a business (Excel Wear v. UOI)
– Available only to citizens, not juristic persons.
Restriction (Art 19(6)(i))	– Professional/technical qualifications (e.g., Bar Council exam for lawyers)
– Must be a law, not executive fiat, and the qualifications must bear a reasonable relation to the profession’s demands.
Restriction (Art 19(6)(ii))	– State monopoly in “any trade” (e.g., liquor, mining).
– Must genuinely serve public interest—not a façade to exclude citizens arbitrarily.
General-public Interest	– Laws for health, safety, environmental protection (e.g., banning pollution-heavy industries).
– Must strike a proportionate balance—no complete negation of the right.
Reasonableness Test	1. Legitimate legislative authority
2. Enumerated object under Art 19(6)
3. Rational nexus / proportionality to that object
4. Non-arbitrariness: no total ouster of the right

5. Case Laws & Critical Analysis

Case	Citation	Holding & Analysis
Chintaman Rao v. State of M.P.	AIR 1950 SC 118	Facts: State holiday G.O. closed factories on too many days.
Held: Violated Art 19(1)(g) as restrictions had no reasonable nexus to public welfare and effectively nullified trade rights.
Significance: First articulation of reasonableness under Art 19(6). 
Mohd. Hanif Quareshi v. State of Bihar	AIR 1958 SC 731	Facts: Restrictions on breeding bulls and working bullocks.
Held: Although in general public interest, legislation must not completely negate the right; restrictions must leave a substantial residue of the right.
Significance: Courts will strike down laws that exterminate economic freedom. 
Bhikaji Narain Dhakras v. State of M.P.	AIR 1955 SC 781	Facts: Veterinary check requirements for bullock carts.
Held: Valid restriction: served public health without absolute prohibition; left owners a reasonable margin to carry on business.
Analysis: Illustrates proportionality rather than blanket bans. 
Sodan Singh v. New Delhi Municipal Committee	(1989) 4 SCC 155	Facts: Hawkers on footpaths challenged NDMC eviction.
Held: Street trading is an “occupation” protected under Art 19(1)(g), but the State may regulate location/time to protect public order and the right of others to free movement.
Analysis: Reinforces that economic freedom coexists with spatial and safety considerations. 
State of Tamil Nadu v. K. Balu	(2017) 2 SCC 281	Facts: Complete ban on liquor sale/consumption along highways.
Held: Valid restriction in the general public interest (road safety), proportionate to the risk posed by drunk driving.
Significance: Modern affirmation that public-safety laws can lawfully curtail trade in dangerous goods. 
Khoday Distilleries v. State of Karnataka	(Karnataka HC, 2005)	Facts: Ban on private liquor retail.
Held: Trade in intoxicating liquor is “res extra commercium”—outside the domain of private economic freedom—so State may impose absolute prohibition without a reasonableness test.
Analysis: Exception for products deemed harmful to public morality, though subject to debate. 

6. Conclusion
The freedom under Article 19(1)(g) is a cornerstone of India’s economic liberties, empowering citizens to engage in lawful professions and businesses. Article 19(6) calibrates this freedom by allowing three narrowly-defined exceptions—professional qualifications, public-interest regulation, and State monopolies—each subject to a rigorous reasonableness and proportionality test. Through cases like Chintaman Rao, Quareshi, Sodan Singh, and K. Balu, the Supreme Court has consistently ensured that economic freedom remains real and substantive, yet responsibly aligned with the general welfare.

FINAL ANSWER: 
=============
1. **Synopsis**
   Article 19(1)(g) guarantees to every citizen the right “to practise any profession, or to carry on any occupation, trade or business.” Article 19(6) qualifies that freedom by permitting the State to impose reasonable restrictions:

   * **(i)** prescribing professional or technical qualifications,
   * **(ii)** creating State monopolies in any trade, business, industry or service, and
   * **(iii)** regulating any occupation, trade or business “in the interests of the general public.”
     Restrictions must be (a) backed by valid law, (b) pursue one of those three aims, and (c) bear a reasonable nexus to their objective, without nullifying the core right .

2. **Introduction**
   By enshrining economic liberty under Article 19(1)(g), the Constitution ensures that citizens can engage in lawful economic activity free from arbitrary State interference. Recognizing that unbridled economic freedom can clash with public welfare, Article 19(6) authorizes narrowly-tailored restraints—striking a balance between individual enterprise and the common good .

6. **Conclusion**
   Article 19(1)(g) secures the fundamental right to economic liberty—practising professions and carrying on trades—while Article 19(6) permits three narrowly-defined exceptions for professional qualifications, State monopolies, and general-public welfare regulation. Judicial precedents—*Chintaman Rao*, *Quareshi*, *Dhakras*, *Sodan Singh* and *K. Balu*—have consistently applied a stringent reasonableness and proportionality test, ensuring that restrictions genuinely serve public interest without obliterating the core freedom. This jurisprudence safeguards meaningful economic autonomy while preserving the State’s ability to regulate for the common good.
