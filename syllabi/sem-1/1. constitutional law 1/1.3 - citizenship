What is meant by citizenship? Explain the mode of acquisisiton and termination of citizenship. Can a company be a citizen? 

1. Synopsis
Citizenship is the legal bond between an individual and the State, conferring rights (Part III) and duties (Art. 51A).
Modes of Acquisition: At commencement (Art. 5), by migration (Arts 6–8), by registration, naturalization and incorporation of territory (Citizenship Act 1955).
Modes of Termination: Renunciation (s 8), termination (s 9) and deprivation (s 10) under the Citizenship Act.
Corporate “Citizenship”: Companies are legal persons but not “citizens” under the Constitution or the Citizenship Act—only natural persons qualify.
Key Cases:
Narasaraopeta Electric Corpn. Ltd. v. State of Madras (1951) — HC held a company cannot satisfy Art. 5 definition 
State Trading Corporation of India v. CTO (1963) — SC bench: companies fall outside citizenship provisions 

2. Introduction
Part II (Arts 5–11) of the Constitution and the Citizenship Act, 1955 together govern who is a citizen of India and how citizenship is acquired or lost. Citizenship determines entitlement to fundamental rights (e.g., Art. 19), franchise (Art. 326) and office (Art. 102), while imposing duties (Art. 51A).

3. Meaning & Definition

Constitutional Meaning
The Constitution uses “citizen” in Arts 5–11; “person” elsewhere (e.g., Art. 14). “Citizen” denotes a natural person who is a member of the Indian polity.
Article 5 (Verbatim)
Article 5. Citizenship at the commencement of this Constitution.
At the commencement of this Constitution, every person who has his domicile in the territory of India and —
(a) who was born in the territory of India; or
(b) either of whose parents was born in the territory of India; or
(c) who has been ordinarily resident in the territory of India for not less than five years immediately preceding such commencement,
shall be a citizen of India. 

Statutory Definition
The Citizenship Act, 1955 (s 2) defines “citizen” as any person belonging to India under Part II or by subsequent registration/naturalization.

5. Case Laws & Critical Analysis
Case	Citation	Holding & Analysis
Narasaraopeta Electric Corpn. Ltd. v. State of Madras	[1951] 21 Comp. Cas. 297 (Mad.)	Held: A company incorporated under the Companies Act does not satisfy Art. 5’s domicile/birth criteria; it cannot be a citizen. This underscores that “citizen” is limited to natural persons. 
State Trading Corporation of India v. CTO	AIR 1963 SC 1811	Held: Citizenship provisions (Arts 5–11) and the Citizenship Act do not apply to companies. The Supreme Court Special Bench confirmed companies are outside the scheme of citizenship, even though they enjoy “personhood” under other statutes. 

Critical Analysis:
While corporate bodies can sue under “person” labels (e.g., Art. 14, Art. 21), they lack the political rights (Art. 326 vote) and civil rights (Art. 19 freedoms) reserved for citizens.
Courts have protected companies’ interests via shareholders’ rights, but citizenship remains the exclusive province of human beings under Indian law.

6. Conclusion
Citizenship in India is a constitutional and statutory construct reserved for natural persons. It is acquired by birth, descent, migration, registration, naturalization or territorial incorporation, and can be lost by renunciation, termination or deprivation. Despite their “legal person” status, companies cannot be citizens—they may vindicate their rights through judicial personhood but do not enjoy the full panoply of rights, duties and political franchises that define Indian citizenship.

| *Narasaraopeta Electric Corpn. Ltd. v. State of Madras* | \[1951] 21 Comp. Cas. 297 (Mad.) | Held that a company cannot meet Article 5’s requirements of birth, parental origin or domicile; “citizen” is expressly limited to natural persons. Emphasizes the framers’ intent to reserve citizenship for individuals (Shukla; Jain).                               |
| *State Trading Corporation of India v. CTO*             | AIR 1963 SC 1811                 | Supreme Court Special Bench ruled that Arts 5–11 and the Citizenship Act do not apply to companies. Although companies possess legal personality under other statutes, they are excluded from citizenship provisions and cannot claim fundamental or political rights. |

**Critical Analysis:**

* **Human-Only Status:** Both constitutional text and statute envisage citizenship solely for human beings, preserving the nexus between individual rights and political membership.
* **Corporate Personhood vs. Citizenship:** While juristic persons may invoke certain rights (e.g., Art. 14), full citizenship entitlements—such as franchise (Art. 326) and Part III guarantees—remain exclusive to natural persons.
* **Balance of Sovereignty and Safeguards:** Citizenship law balances state sovereignty in admitting and removing citizens with procedural safeguards (e.g., notice and appeal in deprivation).

6. **Conclusion**
   Indian citizenship is a dual framework—constitutional (Arts 5–11) and statutory (Citizenship Act 1955)—reserved exclusively for natural persons. It may be acquired by birth, descent, migration, registration, naturalization or territorial incorporation, and lost by renunciation, automatic termination or state-ordered deprivation. Companies, despite their legal “person” status elsewhere in the Constitution, cannot be citizens and thus lack the full panoply of political and civil rights inherent in Indian citizenship (Shukla; Jain).
