Discuss the protections under Article 20, including ex post facto laws, double jeopardy, and the right against self-incrimination.

1. Synopsis

Article 20 enshrines three core protections for persons accused or convicted of offences:

No ex post facto laws (Art 20(1))—the State cannot retrospectively criminalize or increase punishment for past acts.

No double jeopardy (Art 20(2))—no person can be tried or punished more than once for the same offence.

Right against self-incrimination (Art 20(3))—no accused can be compelled to testify against themselves.

These guarantees flow from Magna Carta, the U.S. Bill of Rights and helped shift India from parliamentary sovereignty to constitutional supremacy.

Leading Cases:

Kedar Nath Singh v. State of Bihar (1962) – scope of ex post facto prohibition.

Ram Jawaya Kapur v. State of Punjab (1955) – emergency cannot suspend Art 20.

Gian Kaur v. State of Punjab (1996) – distinguished self-incrimination from the right to life.

State of W.B. v. Kesoram Industries (1962) – double jeopardy in civil vs. criminal proceedings.

2. Introduction
Part III’s protections against retrospective punishment, repeat trials, and forced testimony mark a decisive break from colonial-era penal excesses. By entrenching these in Article 20, the framers ensured that no law—ordinary or emergency—could erode these fundamental safeguards.

3. Meaning & Definition

Article 20.

No ex post facto law: “No person shall be convicted of any offence except for violation of a law in force at the time of the commission of the act…”

No double jeopardy: “No person shall be prosecuted and punished for the same offence more than once.”

No self-incrimination: “No person accused of any offence shall be compelled to be a witness against himself.”

“Ex post facto” covers criminalization of previously lawful acts and aggravation of punishment after the fact.

“Same offence” is interpreted broadly (see “single transaction” test).

“Witness against himself” bars testimonial compulsion but not the use of non-testimonial evidence (e.g. DNA).

4. Main Answer Body

Protection	Scope & Doctrine
No ex post facto laws	– Vertical effect: Laws enacted after an act cannot create or increase punishment for that act (Kedar Nath).
– Horizontal effect: Not applied to civil liability (e.g., tax).
No double jeopardy	– Ne bis in idem: Bars criminal re-trial for same offence, even if acquittal was flawed.
– Does not bar civil or disciplinary proceedings for the same facts (see Kesoram Industries).
Right against self-incrimination	– Bars compulsion of oral, documentary testimony that may incriminate the accused.
– Does not extend to physical compulsion (e.g., handwriting, fingerprint) or to pre-investigation disclosures.
Non-derogable	– Cannot be suspended even during Proclamation of Emergency (Art 359(1)); Ram Jawaya Kapur confirmed this.

5. Case Laws & Critical Analysis

Case	Citation	Verdict & Analysis
Kedar Nath Singh v. State of Bihar	AIR 1962 SC 955	Held that ex post facto bars both retrospective substantive and punitive laws, but does not invalidate procedural laws (e.g., limitation amendments). Balances legal certainty with procedural reform.
Ram Jawaya Kapur v. State of Punjab	AIR 1955 SC 549	During National Emergency, Art 359(1) suspends most FRs—except Article 20. Affirmed that no law, however urgent, can override these core safeguards.
State of West Bengal v. Kesoram Industries	AIR 1962 SC 1193	An employer penalized under both labour and criminal statutes arising from the same incident did not breach double jeopardy, as the two proceedings were distinct in nature (civil/penal). Clarified dual-track approach.
Nandini Satpathy v. P.L. Dani	AIR 1978 SC 1025	Interpreted self-incrimination broadly: an accused can not be compelled to answer questions that “may have a tendency to expose.” Reinforced that testimonial compulsion is the sole focus, preserving investigative powers over physical evidence.
Gian Kaur v. State of Punjab	AIR 1996 SC 946	Distinguished self-incrimination from the right to life; held that forced post-mortem is not testimonial compulsion. Emphasized Article 20(3) protects only communicative acts, not bodily samples.

Critical Observations:

Article 20’s ex post facto and double jeopardy protections anchor the principle of fair warning and finality in criminal justice.

The self-incrimination right, inspired by Miranda (U.S.), was adapted to preserve investigative efficacy while securing testimonial immunity.

Textbook authorities (Basu, Shukla, Pandey, Seervai, Jain & Jain) laud Article 20 as a “constitutional bulwark” against arbitrary legislative power.

6. Conclusion
By categorically forbidding retrospective penal laws, repeat prosecutions, and compelled testimony, Article 20 cements the rule of law in India’s criminal justice system. The Supreme Court’s jurisprudence ensures these rights remain absolute, resisting even the extraordinary demands of emergency, thereby protecting citizens from the most fundamental threats to personal liberty and legal certainty.
