2. Introduction
The Right against Exploitation—enshrined in Articles 23–24 of Part III—reflects the Constitution’s commitment to human dignity by outlawing ancient practices of forced labour, human trafficking, and child labour. These provisions not only impose negative restraints on the State but also create positive obligations for enactment and enforcement of protective legislation.

3. Meaning & Definition

Article 23.
(1) Traffic in human beings and begar and other similar forms of forced labour are prohibited and any contravention of this provision shall be an offence punishable in accordance with law.

“Traffic in human beings” includes sale, purchase, recruitment, and disposal of persons as commodities.

“Begar” denotes involuntary labour without remuneration.

“Compulsory service” for public purposes (e.g., conscription) is the sole exception, subject to non-discrimination.

“Hazardous employment” covers any occupation detrimental to a child’s health, safety or morals.

4. Main Answer Body

Provision	Scope & Enforcement
Article 23(1)	Absolute ban on forced labour and human trafficking by State or private individuals—violation is punishable. Enforced via:
• Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976 (abolishes debt bondage).
• Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956 (combats trafficking for prostitution).
Article 23(2)	State may require compulsory public service (e.g., jury duty, community service) but must not discriminate on religion, race, caste or class.
Article 24	Absolute prohibition on child labour (< 14 yrs) in factories, mines, or hazardous work. Extended and detailed by:
• Child Labour (Prohibition & Regulation) Act, 1986 (regulates permissible work for 14–18 yrs and prescribes penalties).
State & Private Duty	Supreme Court has held Articles 23–24 apply against private actors as well as State—courts may issue preventive and remedial orders (e.g., release, rehabilitation, compensation).
Positive Obligations	Parliament empowered to strengthen protections (Art. 23(2), 24(1))—hence the bonded labour, child labour, and trafficking statutes, plus PILs, are valid exercises of this power.

5. Case Laws & Critical Analysis

Case	Citation	Holding & Analysis
Bandhua Mukti Morcha v. Union of India	AIR 1984 SC 802	Held: Bonded labour violates Art. 23(1). SC mandated identification, release and recovery of rehabilitation costs from employers. Analysis: Transformed Art. 23 into an enforceable right, endorsing PIL to protect bonded labourers. 
lawfullegal.in
People’s Union for Democratic Rights v. Union of India (Asiad Workers’ Case)	AIR 1982 SC 1473	Held: Exploitative working conditions (no minimum wages, unsafe housing) for Asiad workers constituted forced labour under Art. 23. Analysis: Broadened Art. 23’s scope to include economic coercion, and directed enforcement of labour standards.

Deena v. Union of India	AIR 1983 SC 1468	Held: Prisoners compelled to labour without remuneration violate Art. 23. Analysis: Even detention conditions must respect the dignity principle underpinning Art. 23. 
drishtijudiciary.com
M.C. Mehta v. State of Tamil Nadu	(1996) 6 SCC 756	Held: Employment of children < 14 in fireworks factories violated Art. 24; SC issued guidelines for evacuation, rehabilitation, and education of rescued children. Analysis: Cemented Art. 24’s non-derogable character and led to stricter regulatory frameworks.

Kosalwatikar v. State of Maharashtra	AIR 2014 Bom 102	Held: Prohibition on child labour in mica quarries upheld; even parental consent or self-employment cannot override Art. 24. Analysis: Emphasizes absolute nature of child-labour ban.

6. Conclusion
Articles 23 and 24 establish the constitutional bedrock against human exploitation, combining absolute prohibitions with positive state duties. Through legislative action and judicial creativity—notably in Bandhua Mukti Morcha, PUDR, and M.C. Mehta—India has progressively operationalized these guarantees, ensuring that no individual is subjected to forced labour, trafficking, or hazardous child-labour, and mandating rehabilitation and effective enforcement as integral to the right against exploitation.
