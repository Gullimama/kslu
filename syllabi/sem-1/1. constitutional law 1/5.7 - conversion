Is conversion a fundamental right? 

1. Synopsis

The Constitution guarantees freedom of conscience and the right to profess, practice and propagate religion under Article 25(1), but the word “propagate” has been judicially confined to sharing one’s beliefs—not to the right to convert another by force, fraud or inducement

Conversion of one’s own religion is implicit in freedom of conscience and thus protected; however, conversion of others (“proselytisation”) is not a separate fundamental right and may be regulated by the State in the interest of public order

Anti-conversion laws enacted by states (e.g., Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Uttar Pradesh) have been upheld as reasonable restrictions under Article 25(1) when they target coercion, fraud or allurement

2. Introduction
Article 25(1) of the Constitution provides that “all persons are equally entitled to freedom of conscience and the right freely to profess, practice and propagate religion,” subject to public order, morality and health. From the earliest post-independence challenges to state anti-conversion statutes, the Supreme Court has grappled with whether the right to propagate encompasses a fundamental right to convert others—and it has firmly answered no, distinguishing propagation from conversion

3. Meaning & Definition

Article 25(1) (verbatim):
“All persons are equally entitled to freedom of conscience and the right to freely profess, practice and propagate religion subject to public order, morality and health.”

Freedom of conscience includes the right to change one’s own religion at will.

Profess & Practice: Internal declaration and observance of one’s beliefs.

Propagate: Communicate and spread one’s faith by exposition of its tenets—but not to exert force, fraud or allurement to convert another

4. Main Answer Body

Aspect	Analysis
Right to Change Religion	Derived from freedom of conscience under Art 25(1), individuals may voluntarily abandon or adopt any faith. Courts have treated this as an implicit fundamental right.
Propagation vs. Conversion	Propagation allows missionaries and believers to present their faith; conversion requires another’s active assent. The Supreme Court held these as distinct activities in Rev. Stanislaus (1977).
Reasonable Restrictions	Under Art 25(1), the State may enact laws to prevent conversions by force, fraud or allurement, classifying such statutes as valid public-order restrictions.
Anti-Conversion Statutes	Madhya Pradesh (1968), Odisha (1967), Uttar Pradesh (2021) and similar laws forbid coercive conversions. Courts have upheld their constitutional validity so long as they target unethical methods.
International Context	India’s position aligns with international human-rights norms that protect freedom of religion while permitting restrictions on coercive or deceptive conversions.

5. Case Laws & Critical Analysis

Case	Citation	Holding & Analysis
Rev. Stanislaus v. State of Madhya Pradesh	1977 SCR (2) 611	Held: The right to propagate religion does not include a right to convert others. Anti-conversion laws banning conversions by force, fraud or allurement are valid restrictions under Art 25(1).

Stanislaus v. State of Madhya Pradesh (Wiki)	Wikipedia summary (1977)	Reiterated that “propagation” is not co-extensive with “conversion,” and that forcible or fraudulent conversion impinges on the right to freedom of conscience. 
en.wikipedia.org
Allahabad HC – Conversion for Benefits	TOI, May 7 2025	Held: Forced or fraudulent conversions for benefits (e.g., reservations) are a fraud on the Constitution and contravene secularism and public order.

Key Precedents Challenge Anti-Conversion Laws	SCObserver analysis (2019)	Court affirmed that freedom of religion does not guarantee conversion; restrictions are valid if targeted narrowly at coercion rather than peaceful proselytisation.

6. Conclusion
While the right to change one’s own religion is an implicit facet of freedom of conscience under Article 25(1), there is no separate fundamental right to convert another person. The Supreme Court’s rulings—from Rev. Stanislaus to recent High Court decisions—have consistently distinguished propagation from conversion and upheld anti-conversion laws as reasonable restrictions in the public-order interest. Demokratically balancing individual liberty with social harmony, India’s constitutional scheme protects the voluntary exercise of faith while curbing coercive or fraudulent conversions.
