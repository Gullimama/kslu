Define “State” under Article 12 of the Indian Constitution; discuss the expanded scope of “State action.”

1. Synopsis
Article 12 defines the term “State” for the purposes of enforcing the Fundamental Rights (Part III). 
Core components: (a) Union executive & legislature; (b) State executive & legislature; (c) all local or other authorities within India or under Government control.
Expanded scope: Judicially widened to include statutory bodies, instrumentalities/ agencies of government and even private entities performing public functions under pervasive control.

Key Tests & Cases:
R. D. Shetty v. IAAI (1977): laid down initial tests for “other authorities.” 
Ajay Hasia v. Khalid Mujib (1981): refined the six-factor “instrumentality” test. 
Pradeep Kumar Biswas v. Indian Institute of Chemical Biology (2002): further clarified “deep and pervasive control.” 

2. Introduction
Article 12 of the Indian Constitution—part of the Fundamental Rights chapter—“defines” who or what qualifies as the State, so that only such entities can be held accountable for rights violations under Articles 14–32. Without a clear definition, private or public bodies performing public functions might evade constitutional scrutiny.

3. Meaning & Definition

Article 12 (verbatim)
“In this Part, unless the context otherwise requires, ‘the State’ includes the Government and Parliament of India and the Government and the Legislature of each of the States and all local or other authorities within the territory of India or under the control of the Government of India.” 
“Government and Parliament of India”: Union executive (President, Council of Ministers) and the two Houses (Lok Sabha, Rajya Sabha).
“Government and Legislature of each State”: Governors, State Councils, Assemblies, and Legislative Councils.
“All local or other authorities”: Municipalities, Panchayats, Drainage Boards, and any body—statutory or otherwise—that is within India’s territory or under Union control.

4. Main Answer Body
Aspect	Detail
Static Definition	Anchored in Article 12—a closed list ensuring that all enforcement of Fundamental Rights is directed against entities exercising public power or performing public duties.
Judicial Expansion: “Other Authorities”	Early Phase: A. K. Gopalan v. State of Madras (1950) confined Art. 12 to purely governmental bodies.
First Extension: R. D. Shetty v. International Airport Authority of India (1977) held that bodies performing governmental functions could qualify as “State.” 
Instrumentality / Agency Test	Ajay Hasia v. Khalid Mujib (1981) distilled a six-factor test to determine whether a body is an “instrumentality” of the State: 

1. Share-capital held by Government
2. Financial assistance meets most expenditure
3. Monopoly status conferred/protected by State
4. Deep & pervasive control by State
5. Functions of public importance; tied to government functions
6. Transfer of a Government department to the body
Control-Function Test	Pradeep Kumar Biswas v. Indian Institute of Chemical Biology (2002) emphasized that the cumulative and pervasive nature of financial, administrative, and functional control is determinative—no single factor is conclusive. 
Recent Trends	Courts have extended Art. 12 to:
• Public‐private partnerships performing core public functions.
• Universities and research bodies funded and regulated by Government.
• Even private schools, if they discharge statutory educational obligations under State control.

5. Case Laws & Critical Analysis
Case	Citation	Holding & Critical Analysis
R. D. Shetty v. IAAI	(1977) 4 SCC 409	Held: International Airport Authority of India—a statutory corporation—was “State” as it performed public functions, enjoyed State protection and monopoly, and was financially and administratively dominated by the government. This marked the first judicial shift from a strict government-only interpretation. 
Ajay Hasia v. Khalid Mujib	(1981) 1 SCC 722; AIR 1981 SC 487	Held: A society running an engineering college was an “instrumentality” of the State under the six-factor test (share-capital, financing, control, public function, monopoly, departmental transfer). Analysis: Provided a flexible, fact-specific framework, preventing formalistic loopholes. 
Pradeep Kumar Biswas v. Indian Institute of Chemical Biology	(2002) 5 SCC 111; AIR 2002 SC 2191	Held: CSIR qualified as “State”—the Court refined Ajay Hasia’s test, stressing pervasive (not merely partial) financial, administrative, and functional control. Analysis: Balanced the need to protect citizens’ rights against public‐sector bodies with the imperative to avoid over-extension to genuinely private entities. 

Critical Observations:
The evolution from purely governmental bodies to instrumentalities ensures effective judicial remedies.
The Ajay Hasia and Biswas frameworks guard against over-inclusiveness by requiring deep State control.
However, ambiguity remains for bodies with mixed public-private governance, requiring case-by-case analysis.

6. Conclusion
Article 12’s definition of “State”—though seemingly narrow—is dynamically interpreted to cover any entity exercising public power or performing public functions under State control. Through landmark rulings (R. D. Shetty, Ajay Hasia, Biswas), India’s courts have ensured that Fundamental Rights remain enforceable against the full gamut of modern governance structures, thereby reinforcing constitutionalism and safeguarding individual liberties against both traditional government organs and their instrumentalities.


FINAL ANSWER: 
=============
1. **Synopsis**
   Article 12 “defines” the term State for the purpose of enforcing Fundamental Rights (Arts 14–32), encompassing:

   * **Core Entities:** Union executive & legislature; State executive & legislature; all local or other authorities within India or under Government control.

   * **Key Tests & Cases:**

     * *R. D. Shetty v. IAAI* (1977) – initial expansion to statutory bodies.
     * *Ajay Hasia v. Khalid Mujib* (1981) – six-factor “instrumentality” test.
